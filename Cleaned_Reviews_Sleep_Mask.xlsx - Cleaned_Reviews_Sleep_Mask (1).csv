'3'.'0',"I got this mask to help with migraines, I get them constantly and they're pretty severe. I do love the weight of the mask, but it's been in the freezer for a few days and got warm in about 10","I like it for the most part but I had to make one critical modification for it to work well: I had to put a hair tie across the bridge of the nose (eventually I'll sew a row of small stitches on it) to keep the beads from migrating from one side to the other, particularly if I'm lying on my side. It also happens with the beads all going to the bottom of the mask when I sit upright with it (darn gravity), so maybe a couple more stitches to compartmentalize them a little bit more. Otherwise, I'm constantly re-distributing the beads instead of??well??relaxing.That said, it's a nice mask! Blocks out light nicely and feels lightweight. Has an adjustable headband, though the 'S?? loop does occasionally slide off on the headband."
'3'.'0',Not blocking the light out very well,"This is nice and weighty and smooth...but the beads move around a lot and there was the light this morning, coming into my eyes. I wish this could be improved, because it has so many things I like...except for the main reason I wear these."
'3'.'0',The only complaint is the plastic square where it tightens the strap is next to my ear which is uncomfortable for a side sleeper. It CAN be adjusted but I guess I have a fat head.?'??'?,Takes a bit to get used to but worth it
'3'.'0',"I bought this mask for my headaches in the morning and it did help with them when I would wear it. I've never really worn an eye mask so I didn't find it the most comfortable thing, but it wasn't bad. Weight isn't too heavy or anything.","Pretty mask, but very heavy"
'3'.'0',"It's a nice mask, it's sewn well, but the mask itself is really heavy on your face so it can't be worn for extended periods of time. Also it doesn't hold the cold for very long. Hours in the freezer equates to only a few minutes of cold on your eyes","I have been experiencing insomnia related to anxiety and this mask has helped. I keep it in the freezer and put it on at night. The weight on my face is very comforting, and the material is really nice. My only complaints are that it doesn't stay cold very long and the strap that goes around your head can come off one side."
'3'.'0',It feels nice but it hooks and when your sleep the hook comes undone,It feels nice but the strap hooks together and it comes undone alot
'3'.'0',Did not stay cold  for long.,"The little beads all sink to the bottom of the mask and make it too much pressure in that section, and the strap does not adjust as much as I'd like. (The strap adjuster also pulls my hair out.) It does block out light, though."
'3'.'0',,
'5'.'0',These are very comfortable and the light blacking is excellent.,I love this sleep mask
'5'.'0',"I absolutely love this sleep mask. It is very comfortable, nicely covers your eyes, blocks 100% all light AND stays on during the night. I tried other types/brands and had to return them all. This is the only winner. Also, it is great that it comes in a pack of 3, its always nice to have more on hand! Worth every penny!",Best masks in the market
'5'.'0',"I'm a pilot and I travel all around the world. I also sleep in sleeping quarters on board our aircraft.I've had 13 years to narrow down the perfect face masks and these are it!!!I've been using these for about 4 years now.Here's something I've learned.The first models were not as sturdy. They were a BIT more flimsy. Also, because we sweat at nights the masks will eventually require washing. They do just fine in the wash. The older models would get even more flimsy, but still worked.The latest models are made with a much sturdier material and even the wash does not soften the!!The biggest upside of these are the eye covers. They allow for you to open your eyes and not get the fabric to burn your eye like a billion hells.As far as cover? They are about 95% there. I'm a side sleeper and yes you get a tiny bit of light coming in but it's very marginal.I tell you this cus I'm an extremely picky sleeper, I need it to be pitch black and super quiet.I even survived using these while we had curtains installed at our new house. I used them for 3 months with 0 curtains or any cover my windows and I still slept like a baby.So good my wife now wears them religiously.",Very well made and attractive . My wife loves them.
'5'.'0',The masks are perfect! I love that it came in a pack of 3 for when I have to wash one thats full of dog hair. Comfortable and adjustable.,Adjustable straps. Dont come off while sleeping.
'5'.'0',Used mask to keep light out for faster sleep,Ive been using these for years. They work great!
'5'.'0',Block everything out.,These are comfortable and effective. They block everything out and stay on all night. Will buy again.
'5'.'0',"Soft, washable, good quality","I am impressed with these comfortable sleep masks. I washed and dried them with no problem. I like the adjustable strap that doesn't hurt my ears like other brands do. I use this daily and it has held up well with no pilling or pealing apart of layers. If you use it over a full CPAP mask in a lit room, you will find some light seeping through so you'd need to add some fabric at the nose, but when I use it, I just pull it down a bit more over the mask and it keeps out the light filtering in my room from street lamps and other outdoor lighting."
'5'.'0',Love this sleep mask!,"I have never been able to sleep in eye masks before because I can't stand the sensation of pressure on my eyelids. These masks are so wonderful because they don't actually touch your eyelids or eyelashes! Not only are they very comfortable, they also work great at blocking light; nothing gets through any cracks! The material is soft, and I love that the band is adjustable. Overall, I am thrilled with this purchase and use them almost every night!"
'5'.'0',"Question to self:why the heck did I wait so long to buy these eye masks?!Holy smokes, with an eye mask blocking out all the pesky light (paired with my ear plugs) and I could sleep through anything!My big ass head is happy the strap is adjustable because I cannot stand it being too tight on my head.  Another plus is the eye area is deeper so your eye lashes arent plastered to your face.  Stays in place despite my thrashing around which is a huge plus. I also love the fact this is a three pack so one can permanently live in my travel bag and the other two can be rotated when (hand) washed.",These are very soft and they're excellent on the eyes because they have an indentation. It doesn't let the material be on top of your eyelids. Good price good quality.
'5'.'0',"I ordered a second time. I need extras for my suitcase and guest room. Super comfy, and perfectly adjustable.",They are very soft and keep the light out. I have dry eye and the help keep my eyes moist.
'5'.'0',Great for those of us who's wives watch tv in bed.  Helps me get a great night sleep,Read the reviews and ordered for the price/quantity. These masks arrived on time. They are soft and the colors are vibrant. The scooped out center for your eye comfort is perfect. I hand washed them before use and they air dried in two days. From the first night they provided the darkness I need to put my overworked brain to sleep. I fall asleep quickly and through the night sleep at that. These are a great purchase. No complaints in three weeks.
'5'.'0',This product is quite comfortable and works well. Money well spent.,"I've never slept better! I have never used one of these before. I chose these because of the reviews, and not having the mask push down on your eyes. They are very comfortable and easy to adjust. They keep the light out. It use to take me two hours or more to fall asleep. I out this in and im asleep with 5-10min. Highly recommend!"
'5'.'0',I love these I work third shift so I sleep during the day and it is bowed so the inside dose not press on my eyes and it is adjustable and comfortable for sleeping.,Work well and comfortable.
'5'.'0',"These are soft and dont rub against your eyes. Effectively block the light without being at all bothersome. The colors are attractive but not distracting. If light bothers your sleep, these are the answer to your problem.",
'5'.'0',Completely block the light!,Very comfortable.  Blocks light completely especially that early morning blinding light allowing me to get another hour of rest.
'5'.'0',"Was looking for an sleep mask for an upcoming trip overseas. These masks are very comfy to wear, and definitely blackout. There's no pressure on the eyes, which I've had issues with other sleep masks previously. Definitely keeping these!",Rest Easy on an Airplane
'5'.'0',These soft eye masks block out sunlight.  Great for daytime naps.,These are so soft and comfortable. The band is adjustable. The material and padding block out the light so I can sleep during the day.
'5'.'0',Ever since I began wearing eye masks while I sleep my life has been changed for the better.(Warning longish review TLDR posted below)I have all kinds of eye masks cause I get migraines,These are great! No pressure or rubbing on your eyes. Very comfortable. It states do not machine wash but I got tired of hand washing them so I've been machine washing them. They come out fine and haven't lost their shape.I definitely recommend these!
'5'.'0',I am obsessed with these!!! They are silky and well made. I can open my eyes while tossing and turning and they don't rub against the mask. This has really helped me fall asleep faster at night.,Still my favorite eye masks after 4 years of use
'5'.'0',"I bought my first set of these 4 years ago, and I have been using them almost nightly ever since. I can be extremely sensitive to light when I sleep. I am prone to getting headaches if I dont cover my eyes at night.These are THE best eye masks I have ever had, considering the price and the way theyve held up over the years. Every face is different, but for me, they dont put unwanted pressure on my nose, they cup around my eyes so my eyelashes dont constantly rub against them, and Im always able to adjust them so theyre just right: comfortable and blocking out all the light.Ive also used them almost nightly for over 4 years, and NONE of them have come apart at the seams. For me, thats what really sets these apart from other molded eye masks like them. The only wear theyve shown after 4 years is losing a little bit of their shape (but not so much that theyre no longer comfortable or functional) and the elastic loosening a bit (which is easily fixed by tightening the strap).The only reason Im buying more now is because my kids keep playing with them and I keep losing them! I will happily buy and use these for the rest of my life.Excellent quality, excellent function, excellent comfort, excellent price. What more can you ask for?",These are well made and extremely light. Love that I can move my eyelashes when on. Wonderful they are totally adjustable too. Highly Recommended to friends .
'5'.'0',I wasn't meant to get up with the sun,"If you are having problems sleeping due to light, buy this! We have been staying at my mother-in-laws for months now taking care of her after my father-in-law passed. Our bedroom here faces east and nothing is stopping the sun coming through at 5:30 in the morning plus the neighbor has a light that shines right through the window:( My husband also works nights so as a day sleeper he has light all day. Our room at home is much darker so all of this light has been difficult to sleep through. I bought these sleep masks on Prime Day out of desperation and it has been a game changer. They are comfortable, which I didn't think they would be, and I am actually sleeping. My husband, who was reluctant to try it, now uses one and has been able to sleep during the day.Final verdict-I would recommendI would buy again"
'5'.'0',"So happy I ordered these eye masks!  The masks  block out all the light, are comfortable to wear and they don't press up against your eyes.",Totally blocks the street light that shines in my window at night
'5'.'0',The city installed a new light but this totally solved my problem. Comfortable and long,"Havent had a problem with them, I love them. I cant see anything when its on my eyes. Theyre good, you should buy them."
'5'.'0',Very comfortable and opaque,These masks are padded and shaped for comfort. The three colors are nice. Most importantly they keep daylight or lamplight out of sight as you sleep. Recommended.
'5'.'0',Love these eye masks they Dent out ever so slightly around the eye to make them comfortable for blinking and they still block out all the light,These are very good quality & soft.  I love them!
'5'.'0',These were very comfortable. The material is silky & smooth.  Best ones I've ever had!,"I really like these in the cooler weather, but in summer they are just too hot."
'5'.'0',Comfortable & Blocks Light,"These eye covers are great! The contour for the eyes allows your eyelids to move without feeling restricted. The masks are adjustable and washable. They do a great job of blocking light, even at the edges of the mask. The price is great too!"
'5'.'0',Very comfortable and effective!,"I liked the color combinations available, but the real selling point is the comfort and the design of the eye masks. The design allows for you to open your eyes in a raised area, so that your eyelashes arent touching the fabric. The other part of the design is that it excels in blocking out light. If you adjust them correctly you can achieve almost total darkness even with your eyes open. I have used these in a clinic setting, and if the room is darkened to begin with, it is completely effective in blocking out the light."
'5'.'0',"Well made, esp for the price.","I bought these for my friend and my long overnight flights. The padding was just right, thick yet light enough it didnt feel heavy on the face. Sorta silky feel, wasnt scratchy. The indents/pockets for the eye comfort was a great feature. Total blackout for sleeping on the flights.  I would definately recommend!"
'5'.'0',Very light & comfortable,I really like these sleep masks! They are very soft/lightweight and not restrictive at all. Blocks out any light perfectly. They were a lifesaver on a recent trip I took that had very bright hotel room at night. Now I always pack them when I'm traveling.
'5'.'0',Ive used a sleep mask for many years.  These are by far the best Ive ever had.  I especially like the contour for your eyes so there isnt fabric laying right on top.,Blocks light without smashing your face!
'5'.'0',My kid and I call these are eye bras. They are fantastic at blocking light and very comfortable. Most of the light leaks are gone. I switched to these after using traditional ones for a long time because they smooshed my eye lashes. I can no longer feel pressure on my eyes with these.,Perfect eye masks. These are the most comfortable ones Ive ever used and theyre not that expensive. Also glad it comes in a 3-pack because I somehow always lose one every few months.
'5'.'0',So comfortable to sleep in!!,Never had one like this but Im loving it! It blocks light 100% and does not put pressure on my eyes! Soft on my skin as well.  Very well made!
'5'.'0',Bought these in a whim. My old mask needed replacing and spotted these while browsing. They work great at keeping light out. Adjustable. Breathable. Easy to clean.,Is it ambien? No but close!
'5'.'0',"I was worried the strap would give me a headache. Headbands give me a headache so I was worried the strap would be a dealbreaker. I was wrong! The darkness relaxes you, and you're asleep in no time.",These is the best sleep mask Ive used! So comfortable and blocks out all the light. And it stays on all night. No other mask has done that. You can fully open your eyes without your eyelashes hitting the material.
'5'.'0',Exactly what I needed for a good nights sleep!,"These sleep eye masks were PERFECT for what I was looking for. Light, soft, and comfortable. I only used it one night but it was a great night of sleep compared to previous days. When I put on the sleep mask, I totally forgot that they were even there. The cupped eyes also added to the comfort.I will say that there was a little bit of light leakage below the nose and right between the eyebrows, however, in a dark room it is totally not a problem. I also cannot attest to the durability of them but time will tell. These seem pretty solid for now!Overall, this was a great product purchase for me and am glad to finally have a quality sleep mask. I would highly recommend these to anyone."
'5'.'0',Great! Eye mask thats cupped & doesnt touch your eyeball.,"These eye masks are amazing! They are neoprene and cupped where the eyeball is only to not touch your eyeball. I sleep with my eyes open, as is hereditary and not uncommon. When I sleep my eyes get dry, and light bothers them, but when I wear these neoprene masks they work to block the light and keep the moisture retained in my eye! Also, you get three, so theyre easy to hand wash with soap squeeze out and hang to dry over a towel to dry overnight, and then you have extra to wear a dry one to bed in the meantime. And you can give one to a family member or friend too. Family loves them too. Love these!!"
'5'.'0',"I initially bought these to take to the hospital when I had my son last week, but forgot to use them. When we got home we discovered he screams if the room is as dark as I like it, so we have three soft lights around the room that make it hard for me to sleep. I decided to give these a go and they are fantastic! Ive never been able to use a sleep mask before but between the eye curve and the adjustable strap, they are comfortable, I dont overheat, and they dont leave a big mark in my face. 100% recommend. Im a side and back sleeper.",Honestly pretty fantastic!
'5'.'0',"I have a hard time sleeping when its not completely pitch dark, maybe its an OCD thing but if I know theres some light, even if I cant see it, it bugs me. Ive tried sleep masks before but theyre not comfortable, they slide around too much and press on my eyes which hurts. These eye masks are really good!The strap stays in place without feeling like its slicing off my ears. The foamy material is very comfortable. The divots for your eyes leaves no pressure on them which is great. And they block out light pretty damn well which is the most important part!They do, as youd expect, soak up a good bit of sweat/oil if youre a sweaty sleeper like myself, so I usually wash them after about 2",These sleep masks are GREAT!
'5'.'0',"I got my first cushioned sleep mask with a travel pillow about a year or so ago and it was completely worn out, so I ordered these as replacements. I was somewhat skeptical because of their price, but figured it was an inexpensive test run. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these masks! I get very restful sleep with them and wake up less in the overnight hours. I love the adjustable strap, as my previous one had Velcro closure that would sometimes get stuck to my hair. They are very soft and comfortable, and dont slip off my head at night. Also, love the stitched edges, as my former one was glued I guess and the fabric had started separating from the foam.",Best eye masks I have EVER found!
'5'.'0',"I am one of those people that prefer complete darkness while sleeping and these deliver. These eye masks have an indent over the eye that helps seal the eye cavity to effectively block out the most light possible. I also notice that if I tighten the loop it blocks out all of the light without hurting me. Many other masks I have tried have not sealed out the light as well and gave me headaches from how tight I like it.I also enjoy that I can, in theory, swap out the masks every couple of days to help with the buildup of oils/sweat, but my other two masks were taken immediately ?'?Cons:","They look even better than in the photo. Love the colors, love the softness & love the sturdiness & comfort. Can even be washed & will keep their form. Great idea for them to be indented on the inside of the mask. Adds for extra comfort. Easy to adjust. Would definitely recommend. A good bargain for the price."
'5'.'0',"Bought the 3 pack for me and my husband and an extra for my travel bag. We both love how comfortably it fits and stays secure on your eyes while you sleep. Both side sleepers, eye masks tend to shift as you shift, but not these ones. They stay out all night!","I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable this was to sleep with at night. It contours the eye area well so there is no light peeking through. The pockets keep direct pressure off the eyelids. (Although sometimes I get eyelash extensions so the pockets may be too shallow for those. I'll have to test that out later). I'm also a side sleeper so the mask was still soft to sleep on and didn't shift while tossing around. Typically other masks slip off my hair. The adjustable strap stayed in place and allowed me to get the right amount of tightness. It also didn't leave sleep lines on my face like other masks have done. I'm happy with the three pack and colors so i can have one for home, travel, and backup."
'5'.'0',Better than other masks,"I use these every night for the last year at least. The spacing for the eyes helps a lot for me as I sleep on my stomach. Other eye masks feel uncomfortable, pressing on your eyes or around your eyes. These havent caused me any discomfort most nights although one night my hair got stuck in strap... Overall I definitely recommend these for their good coverage and comfort."
'4'.'0',I bought these to protect my lash extensions and they have worked perfectly. The slight concave design has worked just as I've hoped. I end up favoring to sleep on one side and that eye always ended up losing more lashes on that side. These helped keep my eye from smashing on the pillow. The second thing they ended up helping with was blacking out the light when my husband wanted to keep the tv on. The flashing light would bother me and these blocked that out. Bought them for one reason and then ended up using them for another. They are very lightweight and soft. The band can be adjusted to fit and cane be slipped on and off very easily. I think they also come in several different color combinations also. They have definitely worked for me everything I've needed. I would recommend and buy again.,"I like the thickness of the soft material; really keeps the light out. The strap is a bit low for me, so I have to push it up above my ears, so it's not perfectly comfortable. But I'm happy with them all in all."
'4'.'0',Good quality,"To be blunt, Ive used these for sleeping, but I use them more for ""bedroom play"" over the years and Ive bought these more than once.  Overall they are good quality for the price and are quite soft and comfortable.Before trying these Ive used similar ones that have Velcro on the strap for adjusting.  Those caused some discomfort with my partners when the rough Velcro rubbed on their skin or caught in their hair.  This one has a completely smooth ""slip lock"" for tightening.  The idea is sound and avoids those issues, but because the strap is also relatively smooth it allow it to loosen somewhat easily if you move your head a lot.Ive developed methods to address this, but be aware that if you are a restless sleeper or use them for other vigorous activities you will need to be prepared to find a way to keep the slip lock at the right tightness.  Overall very good and will continue to buy these when the need arises."
'4'.'0',I use these quite frequently. I like the molded cups for the eyes. My eyelashes do not touch. They are fine for lowering the amount of light but they do not eliminate all light.,Its not eye protection for people who sleep with their faces smushed into their pillows
'4'.'0',"The light was blocked but I bought this bc I sleep with my face all mashed & smashed into my pillow. When I wake up, I have to wait like an hour for my eyeball to pop back into its spot from the pressure of this giant head that lays on top of it on the pillow all night. This mask kept it dark but all it did was create a layer of material in addition to my pillow case to smush my face into. Im returning to look for something more therapeutic. Great for $10 if you only want darkness.",These are pretty darn good
'4'.'0',They work for the most part but no matter what the headband that goes around your head always hurts! I tried above the ear and below the ear. I tried wrapped in a bun.,I wanted to like these but theyre just not working.
'4'.'0',They fir over the eyes but do not block the light 100%.  And then while sleeping I always wake up with them off to one side.,"Overall this is an excellent product. I use a sleep mask daily and have tried a number of brands. My go to is a manta mask. They don't use an elastic band. Manta masks are a little too warm for me in the summer so I switch to a nylon mask. This mask uses a slider band adjustment that is excellent. This type of band offers the greatest flexibility for sizing and it's easy to use. I gave 4 stars for 2 reasons. First, the eye cup is too shallow. Secondly, the mask coverage doesn't work for me. If the mask slides on your face light gets in. The mask should be a little larger. All and all good mask. I recommend for a small face."
'4'.'0',"I bought these for my son for Christmas and the jury is still out. They look like little bras.  They block out light as intended, but not sure about over all design.  A flatter face mask would be a little bit better than these, at least for general purpose use.","Light still comes in near the nose. Does not shape to your face unless you tighten it, however, by that time it's too tight. Otherwise very comfortable"
'4'.'0',Great value just not as secure,The fact that you get 3 for the price for 1 makes this a competitive buy vs other options on Amazon. Especially since I always lose them! The only downside is the strop sometimes slips upward for some reason but other than that it's a great purchase to truly get some deep sleep without having to buy blackout curtains.
'4'.'0',"Comfy, but bright light gets through","Mostly happy with these, but if my hubby forgets to turn off the lamp when he comes to bed, the light starts seeping through"
'4'.'0',soft and covers eye area well,fits smaller adult face
'4'.'0',"Soft, decent sleep mask","Overall it does its job! When I wear it, it blocks out all light and is nice and soft on my face. My only complaint is that it tends to slide up my face while I sleep--Ive tried adjusting the tightness of the band, but it doesnt help too much. Might be due to just how silky the mask is. But that downside doesnt bother me too much, so this item was worth purchasing for me!"
'4'.'0',They Dont Block out 100 percent of light but much better than regular sleep masks!,"I was thinking it would block out 100 percent of light with the design but it doesnt so I guess maybe my expectations werent realistic with that but still very happy and far superior than other sleep masks they are comfortable, adjustable strap and very soft. Would recommend"
'4'.'0',Quality product for Quality Sleep,"Bought these twice (over a few years) and Im buying them again! I work a day job and throw newspapers at night, so these are ESSENTIAL for daytime naps to keep me going!  Out of the 6 Ive bought - 1 just got wore out and went flat after a TON of use, 1 came unsewed after a TON of use and the rest are still going strong.  They stay on pretty well as long as Im not tossing and turning that night. Pros: deep eye cups are comfortable and dont put pressure on my eyes or bend my lashes. Very light proof foam.  The buckle is super adjustable.  Nice and smooth all around, edges and seams are even smooth.  Love that there are 3 in case one falls behind the bed, one for daily use and one to stick into my suitcase for travel. Cons: no covering for the nose which causes light Infiltration a bit, and you have to tighten them up pretty firmly to keep out light and make sure they stay on.  The elastic is getting stretched out after several months of constant use.  (used same mask nightly for 6 month).  Would be 5000 stars with a small nose pocket to keep light out and the mask in place.  It has really helped step up my sleep game, and soothes my night anxiety - especially when used along with a compression sleep sack."
'4'.'0',No pressure on eyelids and less abrasion on natural lashes. The contoured shape and cushioning around each eye really helps keep out light. If they had 2 straps,"These work great and are very comfortable on the face with little to no light gaps, whichis great. My only complaint is that the hook on the left side (when youre wearing it) can be extremely uncomfortable behind your ear because it isnt covered with anything soft to stop it digging into your head. So if youre a side sleeper or tend to turn your head a lot, you may not find this comfortable. I eventually found a way to make them work by how I position the strap on my head with my sleep bonnet, but I can see it being a problem for some."
'4'.'0',This blocks light well and is comfortable. It does sometimes slip when rolling over.,Not made for Caucasian faces
'4'.'0',"The nose opening is too low. I'm guessing it was made for Asian faces. I'm Caucasian and when I get it on my nose correctly the face mask presses on my eyeball. Even if I try to wear it lower, after a few minutes it moves on it's own and is uncomfortable. It is well made, just doesn't fit me or my husband correctly.",I think the nose piece could be thicker because it does let in a bit of light around the nose. I don't like how tightly I have to wear the mask in order for the light not to shine through. Overall for price and quality they kind of equal out.
'4'.'0',Light gets around my nose,Would be perfect if light didn't get under the nose area. It also slips with the smallest movement causing light to stream through the sides as well. Not a good for me
'4'.'0',"Comfortable, easy, and fits well enough","Slight gap in the nose area, which might be less of a problem if your nose is shorter than mine. Otherwise theyre comfortable and effective. Ill probably hand-stitch in a bit of extra padding to help with the nose issue."
'4'.'0',"Sleep mask, not really what I was looking for.","Ok, these sleep masks do the job I got them for, but I thought these were the REALLY thin stiff neoprene ones (which these are not).  These are like the standard cotton ones but with material scooped out of the middle of where your eyes go.  I honestly would have rather had the thin neoprene ones, as those dont make contact with your eyelids AT all, while these still do a little....also the thick cotton causes me to sweat at night where the bulky cotton touches around my eyes.  Also sleeping on my side, my pillow hits right at the edge of the sleep mask, knocking it out of place on my face which is a bit annoying.To be fair, other than those points these masks work perfectly fine as they are, and Im not troubled enough to return them or to buy the actual neoprene ones.  Im just like....whatever....fine.  They do the job, so it gets the 4 stars."
'4'.'0',Soft and comfortable. It fits pretty securely around my eyes and nose. No light gets under or around it unlike typical sleep mask. The only complaint I have it that the strap has a tendency to slide up the back of my head while I sleep.,"As far as eye bras go, these are DDs. Your eyelashes dont touch these generous cups"
'4'.'0',"So, Im a big hairy dude. In a lineup and you had to pick out who is likely to wear eye masks to bed, I would be one of the last people standing, but.... Much to my dismay, I have a flaw. Its only one so I can get over it, but my eyes dont close fully when I sleep. I dont mean the freaky people who look like theyre awake, just not fully closed. It means my eyes dry out terribly through the night if I dont have a mask on. Most masks cause my eyelashes touch the eyepiece. Im quick to ignore most such things, but it is nice that I dont have to with these. I have to loosen the strap completely so the cups lay mostly naturally (too tight and they get misshapen) and it would be nice if there were a couple more inches available (thats what who said?) In the strap, but in a motorcycle helmet I wear an XL which is big enough to serve as a semi natural habitat for horses etc. So, that is more of a problem with my huge melon than the mask. Im ordering 3 more packs because these types of products come and go, or change manufacturers and lose quality. Also, the notch is big enough to actually go around your nose, so the light blocking is pretty good, especially for a mask that isnt that tight. I wouldnt say 100%, but in the 90s. Definitely blocks the air from the (always on) ceiling fan with my stupid partially open eyes.",Soft & Blocks Light However the Plastic Sizer on Back Hurt my Head After Sleeping
'4'.'0',These eye masks are great and do a wonderful job blocking light. They are soft and comfortable on the eyes. What I had a problem with was the plastic slider on the back. It fit my head right in the middle and as I was sleeping (even with a pillow) I could feel it pushing into my head and it became painful. I returned these and ended up getting the version with the velcro closure.,"I need total darkness to sleep, and my partner likes a night light. These are good at blocking out the light. They're mostly comfortable and the adjustable strap is nice. I deducted one star because the strap is very stiff and hurts the tops of my ears. I wish the elastic was softer or coated."
'4'.'0',Finally can Sleep in darkness!,"My parents have these sleep masks.I told them they look like little bras for a little dolls. They left, but said that they're excellent. After trying it out, I decide to buy a set for myself. They are good. You definitely sleep in darkness. The only thing that I dislike, as they feel kind of warm at times. Otherwise a good purchase."
'4'.'0',"I didnt think I would actually be able to sleep with this on, but I actually did. I washed it prior to using. Very soft on my face which is important because I have very sensitive skin. I only have two minor issues:The part around my nose let light in. Not a huge deal, but it wasnt completely black out.It did shift several times and I had to reposition it. Im sure its because I move a lot and have a lot of hair. But It bothered me enough to wake me up.Overall its a good product and worth the money.","Eye part super comfy, strap pinches"
'4'.'0',The eye part is super cushy and works great. Very comfy. The back strap isn't as comfortable,"Close, but not quite as good as needed"
'4'.'0',"These are fine, if you sleep on your back and dont move the whole time that you are asleep.  If I tighten the strap enough to keep it in place, it makes an opening beside both sides of my nose that lets light in, defeating the whole purpose of the thing. If I leave it loose enough to seal out the light, any movement at all makes it fall off.  It really needs some sort of flexible frame around it. Something that can be shaped to fit different shapes of different faces. Something around the outside edge, that can also be molded to different shaped noses. And be ridged enough to be held in place by a headband that will keep it in place, and wont fall off when the wearer turns over in their sleep.  I suppose that if the user can sleep on their back, without moving, the whole time they are asleep, then this will work perfectly for them! If you move around in your sleep, then these probably wont work very well for you.  I worked for over 25 years on rotating shifts in machine shops. So I know what its like to try to sleep during the day and still put in a 10 hour shift at night for 2 weeks of four 10 hr shifts. Then do 2 weeks of five, 8 hr day shifts.  I also worked several years of rotating 8 hr shifts to keep a shop running 24",These are pretty good. I wanted them as extras and they work for that. They have to be too tight to be comfortable to block all of the light.
'4'.'0',Head band placement..,"The headband had to go over my ears for the mask to be centered over my eyes. OK but not perfect. My previous sleep mask had two bands, but was flat and my eyelashes touched it."
'4'.'0',These work better if you tighten the band up a bit.  Plan to buy more,"Perfect size and shape, edges a little rough"
'4'.'0',Perfect eye coverage once you get the right fit on the elastic. Nice cushion around the eye. The edges at the end of the fabric could be finished better so its not so raw and rough on the skin.,These eyeshades are ok. I had some that covered the bridge of the nose better
'4'.'0',I LOVE how these give your eyes room to move under them! They got a little warm on my eyes after a while but I still love these.,"i had no idea i needed a weighted sleeping mask, after hearing from twitter i decided to give it a try. super comfortable, interesting feeling. but finding the right tightness takes some time. this has nothing to do with the product, it is about your personal choice. it took me three nights to find the optimum tightness. Black is real black, no leak or whatsoever. I started using it in summer, so sweating is a little bit of an issue, but i am sure when the weather calms down, it will stop being a problem."
'4'.'0',Pretty Good Value .... But,"I received this sleep mask 8 days ago, and I have worn it overnight 7 times. I have written about my experience below:When I put this sleep mask on, I found it very comfortable, and I was immediately struck by just how good the light-blocking was. I was testing it during the day, with the sun shining in and essentially no shortage of ambient light. Despite this, I could not see any light leaking in, from any angle.The fabric on the inside (i.e. that is in contact with the wearers face) is soft, and I did not feel anything touching my eyes/eyelids while wearing the mask - owing to the indents that line up with the wearers eyes.I would point out to potential buyers that you will need to find a balance between having the strap tight enough that the mask doesnt slip off/dislodge in the night, and loose enough that you dont end up with temporary impressions in your skin upon waking. While the former is common sense, the latter may come as a surprise.In my opinion, this mask is perfect for back sleepers, or for any situation in which the wearer is sitting upright/almost upright while snoozing (e.g. on a flight). This mask isnt so great for side sleepers, in my experience, since the side of the mask can press in to the wearers temple, on whichever side the wearer is lying on.A final note is that the customer service provided by the seller is excellent. I wrote to the seller about those skin impressions mentioned above, and the seller responded promptly and was extremely helpful.Seller: 10/10Product:  For back sleepers, or use while sitting upright: 10/10  For side sleepers: 6/10  Light blocking: 10/10"
'4'.'0',They are very well made,Can't sleep late without them.  Second purchase.
'4'.'0',Soft and well,"For sleeping at night, no problem ....  but for day sleepers there is a slight amount of light leakage around the nose pad, however itll probably not bother most.  Still a good value for the price."
'4'.'0',Definitely give these. Wash before use.,"Strap: 9.5/10Fabric: 9/10Stitching: 8/10Mask shape: 10/10Smell out of packaging: 2.5/10The adjustable strap is a game changer. The plactic pieces on the strap are thin and small; I dont even notice them when wearing.The mask itself is a soft memory foam texture, with a silky fabric over top. The fabric stays relatively cool when wearing. Other masks in the past have given me the face sweats, but this one has kept my eyes cool and dry. The stitching is very secure, but has some untrimmed ends the could have been better cleaned up.The shape is wonderful! Keeps the light out, hugs my face nicely, flexible material and doesnt leave behind any lines on my face. When I blink with the mask on my eyelashes dont hit the inside of the mask. Love it!Now on to the negative... The masks smelt AWFUL when I first opened the package. The smell permeated through the room. I had to light a candle to ease the smell. The easiest way to explain the smell itself is fresh from the factory. Ive only ever smelt that smell when working retail and it was usually much lighter. Its a distinct chemically smell.I threw those masks in a tupperware with some laundry soap, and shook the smell away. Gave it a light hand scrub and many rinses; A good amount of dye and dust came out. After a good wash they were perfect! Ive had zero issues with them and I wear them every night.Great price, good quality, and helps me get a good night sleep! Just dont forget to wash them well before wearing. Would recommend and purchase again!"
'4'.'0',i like them but i should have gotten designs because you can see how oily my face is.,Love how they fit an the darkness.they provide
'4'.'0',Good product but wish it didn't smell like some kind of chemicals.,"As my hubby now goes to sleep before the sun goes down, I bought these for him, and for me on the other end of that spectrum, sleeping in a bit after sunrise.Theyre soft, feel silky, and the design with the dome shape to keep them from pressing against your eyes is great.  They dont block out 100% of the light, there are always little gaps here and there, but its about 90% and thats great."
'4'.'0',,The three masks come on a card in a sealed pouch. Very soft while wearing and block most of the light for me.My only complaint would be they have an odd smell out of the packaging. The card they are on suggests to wash before use. I would suggest this is mandatory.
'4'.'0',No pressure on the eyes. Soft.,Good quality but chemical smell
'4'.'0',"This works well for keeping the mask off of my eyes.  I decided to wash mine before using next to my eyes, and the wash water looked like dirty muddy river water.  I washed them by themselves, in the sink, so I know the dirt came from the masks.  Be sure to wash before use!",I like having the indentation for my eyes. I do not like the foam feeling fabric.
'4'.'0',"The mask works well, but the strap is rubs on my ears and gets sore in the night. Washing it helped soften it a little.",Be sure to wash before use
'4'.'0',"It works very well blocking light, but it gets creased easily. Side sleeping has some light seep though.",A little heavy for this heat.
'4'.'0',These block light well and are comfortable with the exception of the sides. There is too much padding there which makes it uncomfortable to sleep on my side with them on.,Keeps the light out but strap could be softer
'4'.'0',They keep the light out,"Works, but it isn't as comfortable as they make it sound."
'4'.'0',,Side sleepers may find uncomfortable
'4'.'0',"These are some of the better masks I have used. Theyre super comfortable and easy to sleep in. They do let some light in around the nose, but block out most light. I would buy again.","Perfect fit for my kids, blocks out all light."
'4'.'0',Comfortable but can slide around a bit,Its dark even when its daylight.  Helps you sleep
'4'.'0',Annoying that its hand wash only but they are comfortable to sleep in and blacks out all the light,They are comfortable and work great. They smell weird and and have to be hand washed and dried before wearing.
'4'.'0',"Im in the process of ordering another set of these face masks. Ive had them for almost two years and they are great. They are domed, so no fabric touches your eyes and they block out light very well.  The adjustable elastic on them, however, is what has made me need new ones. Over time the elastic just stretches out too far making it too loose.  I highly recommend these masks.","These dont smash your eyeballs so are comfortable to wear all night. The only issue I have is it tends to slip upwards, I guess because the nose cutout isnt deep enough. Its fine though, as it doesnt come right off"
'4'.'0',"I bought this after losing my other eye mask, because I liked the price point (and I still do). I will say though, I can tell",Quick shipment. Kind of comfortable kind of not.
'4'.'0',These fit very nicely.  They do Not rub your eyelashes!  Only complaint is that they have a very strong chemical or plastic type of smell.  Hoping this goes away with time or a couple washes.,These are wonderful sleep masks
'4'.'0',Not quite light proof,Good for what it cost
'4'.'0',Work well . No complaints,"I have been using it for a long time and it greatly improved my sleep, note that you have to get used to the fact that it tingles your ears a little..."
'4'.'0',"Very soft and comfortable.  However, the fitment around the nose allows light in.","It does a good job of not touching my eyes or squeezing my head, but it lets light in from the top above the bridge of the nose.This isn't a fit issue. You can see vertical lines next to the bridge of the nose in the picture. I think they're relief cuts to allow the mask to fit better. You would have to fold the mask in half to close them entirely. These are also on the inside of the mask so when the mask is on there is still a vertical gap on either side of the nose. It's not a lot of light and it's indirect so it might not be a big deal, but for something like a light sensitive migraine it was noticeable. For most scenarios it's a quite good mask.I also have a hard time keeping it on my face all night but i have that issue with every mask I try. This one was comfortable and fit nicely at least."
'4'.'0',These are very soft and I love that they dont have velcro! Unfortunately I have long natural eyelashes and even with the indentations they made my eyes feel a little squished so had to return,These work well AND and wash well...
'4'.'0',Works but a little warm,"They work very well at keeping out light. The band is cheap elastic, though, and wears out fast."
'4'.'0',"Very nice, but they shift to the side for side sleepers","Nice, but not for long eyelashes"
'4'.'0',,I have ordered these twice. They are great. Only issue is the strap broke on one and on another the elastic strap lost elasticity after about a year
'3'.'0',"So I was super excited to get these, they looked comfy and had good reviews. I opened the bag and they are soft and look nice, however, one of them is already sized and has spots from something on the inside part that would sit up against my face. Im guessing I got someones return and they didnt check them. With a global pandemic going on, you would think that they would be checking something like that for sanitary reasons. Im kind of upset that I got someones used mask. Thankfully it doesnt look like the other two were touched and Im going to wash them a few times because I do want them, but I cant rate something used, that I should have received new, as higher than 3 stars.",Does the job but the foam thickness makes it a little warm.
'3'.'0',These sleep masks were very cheaply made for people with giant faces. I have a normal size head and face so the masks do not fit perfectly therefore allowing alot of light to come in. The adjustable strap is also flimsy and hard to adjust.,These mask are seriously comfortable.  Feel good on my face. These can be adjusted to fit. Great purchase.
'3'.'0',Falls off often during the night,It doesnt quite block out everything as it doesnt lay flat over your nose.  It looks like a tiny bra.
'3'.'0',READ INSTRUCTIONS FIRST,Nice but quality issues
'3'.'0',I dislike the plastics piece to adjust the size of the mask. Falls right by my ear and is irritating.,"Ok, what can I say about this? the material is OK but its not the best.  Would have been nice if it was more padded around the rim area.  The nose opening is a bit too large. I am able to see through that part.  On a hot night, this is not very comfortable to wear again because of the material.  Overall, I give this 3 Stars only because you get 3 in the pack.  Some reviewers say that they received a different item than what was advertised. As you can see from the photo. I was sent the same item as advertised, the item came in a tightly sealed pouch and the other 2 photos shows what it looks like once opened.  You might think that you are getting 3 different sizes, but this is not true. all 3 are exactly the same size."
'3'.'0',Lasted for *almost* two months??the cups that protect the eyelashes are already flattened out.,Theyre soft and silky but the light comes through around the top and bottom.
'3'.'0',Improvements to be done,"So, these are replacements for other face masks that I have used and loved, and I used and loved these.  I got to my third one, after the cats ran off with my other two, and the packaging inside that the masks are wrapped around, so if you dont pull them all out immediately, you dont actually see, tells you to wash the face masks before use.  What'  Brand new products dont generally warrant that.  And washing the face masks is good to do now and then to get the facial oils off, but I think its pretty sketch to send a product that immediately needs to be cleaned.  Especially since I wore all three without washing them.  I didnt notice any ill effects, so coloration on my skin or anything, but anyone looking to buy these would probably want this information."
'3'.'0',"They seemed thick enough to stop the light from coming in, But a bit heavy on the sinuses all night long. Then I looked at my kid in one of them??It looked like he had a padded bra on his face.And he did not sleep any better. Nor could I. It twisted around my face in the middle of the night.So we returned the bra eye covers.","Pretty disappointing, need to find a new higher quality set to continue receiving the great sleep I have been."
'3'.'0',Good: shuts out light. Washable. No Velcro.Not so good: eye wells are small. See photo,the elastic need to be improved in order to keep its flat shape and not ending up like in the picture I am attaching .....very annoying!!!
'3'.'0',Had to wash these upon arrival. They have a very bad smell to them. Not sure what it's made from.,Look at The Picture Before You Buy
'3'.'0',"Everything about this mask was great but I only gave it 3 starts because they dont last. Having purchased many sleep masks in my life I wasnt expecting too much of these because they were inexpensive. They keep the light out better than most masks Ive had (not completely but almost), the elastic is adjustable and theres no Velcro involved which is great, theyre light weight and soft. But the quality is not great. I wont call these masks cheap because theyre well made for the cost. But they probably sell three at a time because they wont last as long as more expensive masks. The elastic in particular is very thin and ""flimsy"". The elasticity died within a month and a half; I had tightened it as far as it would go and eventually 1.5 months into it, I had to throw it away and go on to the next mask. So these masks will last me 4.5 months total before having to buy more. All in all thats not bad but Id rather buy a more expensive, well made and long lasting mask the next time and have it last the 1.5 years they normally last me.",Not for people with big eyes.
'3'.'0',"I like these because they are raised off your eyelids so you can blink and sleep without any pressure whatsoever on the eyelids. The only downsides are that they move very easily on your face and light can seep in from the bottom pretty easily. If you toss and turn like I do, youre going to have to frequently re",The material stinks 
'3'.'0',These are adjustable but still bulky and tight. I was not real fond of them and sleeping in them isnt all that great.,Poor production quality
'3'.'0',All is great except that the color rubs off on my pillow cases. So far it has washed off in the washer but I will not buy again.,No pressure on the eyes
'3'.'0',Smooth fabric but uncomfortable elastic strap,Tight and not very comfortable
'3'.'0',Not good for sleeping,color bleeds onto sheets
'3'.'0',"Not the best, but okay",Does not block light fully bc there is either a gap by nose sides if on bridge ofnose or has to sit too far down on nose to get more coverage. Also elastic is not soft and slips off during sleep. Slightly wider top to bottom would help close gapping. Fabric is comfy tho and foam padding helps keep from feeling too tight
'3'.'0',Keeps light out if you wear it right. No matter how I adjust the straps the mask itself puts too much pressure on my sinuses and gives me a headache. Would return if I could. Wont repurchase and do no recommend.,"This would not stay on my eyes while sleeping. In order to line-up properly, the single strap had to go over my ears and kept slipping off, no matter how tight. If you were using this for a plane or something else to block light it might be fine, but not for sleeping."
'3'.'0',"I really like the concept of this sleep mask.  Great idea not having any seams.  Also, being able to tighten it without velcro is wonderful.  Its quite comfortable.  However, the size of this diminuative mask is basically designed for a childs face.  You can barely cover your eye sockets with it as the concave area for the eyes is MUCH too small and actually tiny.","The Mask part is nice and soft.  Unfortunately,  the elastic band is sewn low enough,  that when wearing it the band rubs against the top of my ears.  I will have to re-do the sewing and raise the band by an 1/8-1/4 in."
'3'.'0',The are nice but thick,"The quality of the material is nice, but the design isnt great. I had a feeling I was not going to like these because I owned a mask like this many years ago and there was still gaps around my nose, but I liked how lightweight it was. So I figured I would try these out to see if those design flaws have been fixed in recent years. Sadly, no. I have a slightly small head/face(well call it petite) and I am a 30 year old female who likes to sleep a lot. But with my smaller face and nose I have to tighten the straps quite a bit, just to get it to mostly block the light out of any gaps. But then, the mask itself is not so ""3D contoured"" once its stretched across a face. AND THEN the strap slides around my head while Im sleeping and I wake up with the mask on the side of my face, like some frat boy who passed out early and got a d*** drawn on his face. I think Ill use these for emergency travel purposes only, and continue hunting for the right mask for me."
'3'.'0',Nice masks and quality but super large,Great sleep mask but too small
'3'.'0',These sleep masks get the job done. They work perfectly for blocking probably 98% of light. In a really bright room a little light can be seen around the edges however they still function well. I can easily fall asleep in a brightly lit room as if it were dark. The only issue I have with them is the comfort of the straps. The straps are pretty thin stretchy fabric that rubs slightly just above the ear which is slightly irritating.,Haven't needed to use mask(s) yet
'3'.'0',I like the adjustable strap and seems tho be well made.  The issue is that it is not deep enough and does result in pressure to the eyes.  I wake up with side eyelids from the pressure on my eyelashes.,The foam is thick on around the eye
'3'.'0',These are a good price for a 3 pack but when they arrived they had a very strong chemical/ plastic smell! I soaked them overnight in laundry soap and let them air dry and that helped. They could stand to have a larger eye indentation area in the inside for those with eyelashes. Otherwise they are comfortable and adjustable.,"Very Effective, Could be More Comfortable"
'3'.'0',Not as form,Very strong odor when opened
'3'.'0',Stink like nail polish remover,Gave me a tension headache
'3'.'0',I love the mask itself but the elastic straps have a metal piece that is part of the adjustment. That piece hurts my head when I lay on my side so they have been unusable.  I am very disappointed!!,"The masks work very well, but the dye in them  will stain pillow cases.  Even pre-washing them does not eliminate the staining. Ugh!"
'3'.'0',Alaska bear is much much softer. Its not even close. This one comes out of the box with a horrid chemical smell too. BUT i did sleep with it and got to bed just fine. For the price its ok. You get 3 for the same price as the Alaska bear.,"Better than a thin piece of fabric, but they still let in some light. If I want it to stay in place all night, I have to wear it so tight that its not very comfortable."
'3'.'0',Design changed,"Weve ordered these three times over at least a year, and this last time theyve really badly stunk. Theyve also never been packaged this way before either, in a long foil/plastic bag with a cardboard holder.I dont know what they are doing different, but the masks havent stunk before.I am wondering if they can be washed or if these are just completely trash. Either way they arent good this time."
'3'.'0',,Not as good as Alaska Bear
'3'.'0',"So far I have had no problems with the mask construction, or the fit of the mask itself. Only time will tell how well they will last with long term use.",They don't work as a side sleeper and they are too heavy.
'3'.'0',"Ive been dealing with some cornea problems and my doctor suggested a mask to protect my eyes while sleeping.  I liked how these have a little ""pocket"" over your eye so its not pressing against the eyes.  However, to get it tight enough to say on my very round head the pockets end up squishing inwards onto my eyes anyways.  I dont have problems with the band getting stuck in my hair or anything, which is nice compared to other masks.  The material of these is very soft and comfortable to have on the face for longer periods.  But in addition to having a very round skull, I also have rounded cheek bones and the mask doesnt quite fit along the bottom, no matter how I adjust it.  The blackout feature is great but once I move my head there is a gap where light pours in.  If youre a back sleeper, this probably wont be an issue.  In order to get the blackout to work, I end up pressing the mask further down the bridge of my nose, and it can feel sharp and uncomfortable where the seam sits.  Overall, not a bad mask.  Not for me, I just dont have the right sized face and proportions for it.  I still use them when I need ot rest my eyes during the day, but I cannot sleep well in them.  They are easy to wash, though, and the eye pocket does pop back.  I think the solution there would be to have a top and bottom string so all the tension isnt in the middle of the pocket area.","I had a set of these years ago that were perfect. But they changed the design since. I ordered a new set and the eye cups are too small. I keep feeling like I need to pull them down. Theyre probably fine for smaller head people, but if youre an adult male, I would keep looking."
'3'.'0',"It definitely blocks out any light which is great, but the strap that goes over your head it's incredibly uncomfortable and the way it rests on your ears rubs them raw. Also, the mask tends to move upwards as you sleep and  as you roll over which causes the raised part that's supposed to sit under your eye to sit on top of your eyes, which is also incredibly uncomfortable.",Different Face Shapes Might Have Better Results
'3'.'0',These are very comfortable and good at blocking the Light.  Work well??..for a while. Strap gets loose and mask seems to break down. Maybe getting 3 weeks out of a mask.  I am going to have to do a 'cost analysis?? on the masks.  Or maybe just spend more dollars for ones that last,Comfy but not blacked out
'3'.'0',"Comfortable but they leak light on each side of the nose. Also, would prefer a solid elastic band without the buckle for adjustment. The bukle winds up on the side of the head and can be uncomfortable.",Not the most comfortable
'3'.'0',"These block light a bit better than the Alaska Bear sleep mask I decided to keep, but the edges are too thick or, at least, too stiff. Im a side sleeper, and the pressure against my temples was uncomfortable, interfering with sleep.The strap is also uncomfortable when sleeping on my left side. The lock ring and extra material that allows adjusting the strap lines up with my left ear, so whether the strap is on my ear, or between my ear and my scalp, it isnt comfortable. For side sleepers with smaller heads, the bump would be behind the ear or head, and therefore not a problem. For back sleepers with a large enough head, the bump would not be at the back of the head, and therefore not a problem.I tried the FRESHME Stores ""100% Handmade Cotton Sleep Mask Blackout",Comfortable but get loose and
'3'.'0',,"Purchased this 3 pack based on the reviews. They arrived in a vacuum sealed pouch that had to be cut open. Once adjusting the strap, it became clear Ferry quickly that they bothered my eyes, something the reviews said would not happen. Needless to say, I immediately returned this, only to receive a threatening email about all of my returns."
'3'.'0',Not good for side sleeper,Sleep mask is alright. The contoured eyes are on the small side and not as comfortable as the earth therapeutics contoured sleep mask. Not worth returning but wouldn't purchase again
'3'.'0',Flimsy but functional,I have false lashes and thought it would work however it is not long enough on the sides for long lashes. Comfort was great however my lashes came off after the fist night and just didnt work. If you dont have false lashes then it was great! Didnt wash them so I dont know how that would have been.
'3'.'0',These are fine for a child or adult with very small head,This product is comfortable and definitely blocks out the light but it is not good if you sleep on your side.
'3'.'0',Cheap dont buy these and let light peak through noise area,"These masks are cheap, flimsy and a little small, but for the most part they get the job done."
'3'.'0',"too small, runs into ears","title pretty much says it all -- if you have more than a button nose, this has a gap at the bottom letting in light. i have a Dream Essentials mask that has an extra bit of fabric around the nose and blocks ALL light, so it can be done."
'3'.'0',Does not cover like it supposed to? will keep but will not order this brand again,The eye wells are not big enough for a large adult. They are just over half the size of the one I bought 10 years ago which has now worn out.
'3'.'0',"Unfortunately, these are not concave enough and press on my eyes.  Loosening the strap doesn't help as that makes the mask too loose and it doesn't stay in place.",This mask would be great for kids or someone with a very small face and head. I read the reviews and people raved about this mask but i will never buy these masks again.I first thought wow three for a small price but i thought that they would be better quality then what they are. When i first put it on it was clear that the mask definitely would slide off my head from the soft material because the band is just a cheap elastic with and adjuster but you have to almost have no blood flow to your eyes if you want it to say on. The mask is slightly bigger then my tv remote. You will be able to see light through the noise hold easily. Its irritating when you are a light sleeper and very sensitive to light. The three pack is nice when it comes to buying them when needing multiple. But i will be definitely be spending a little more money when it comes to buying a different mask. It does feel like a cheap memory foam shoe insert that was made into a sleeping mask. I dont know how long it will hold up to being used long term.Update: customer service reached out to me about this review. They did refund me $15 which is greatly appreciated. They gave me a choice to either receive $15 compensation or a updated version of the masks. But they do beg for you to take it down or update it to 4 stars and then try to use the current situation to try and change your opinion to a 4 star review. I just dont think the product deserves a 4 star solely based on the product itself. I understand during the pandemic its hard on everyone but I do want the product to speak for itself then give false information.
'5'.'0',TWO BROS REVIEW SAY: Best way to get rid of eye strain,I decided to try these masks based on the excellent value - 3 masks for very little money. This was to replace a Nidra masks that I have been using with love for years but was falling apart. This mask is no where as comfortable as the Nidra mask because it rubs on the top edge of my ears. Ill probably keep these as a back up and buy myself another set of Nidras. Im a small woman so the smaller size should work but it just doesnt. Maybe they are better on bigger heads. Quality is very good however and will probably last a long time.
'5'.'0',These masks hold the cold well help for eye pain.,The band tighteners make it difficult to sleep on your side...which i do. Have stopped using these.
'5'.'0',I love this sleep mask. It helps with a headache. Its very comforatable and soft.,"Hey everyone, Two Bros Review here, as always we are on youtube for more indepth analysis. First off this was a personal purchase for me since I wear glasses and was suffering from eye strain. Enter this mask right here. Not only did it get rid of eye strain quickly but it helped ease headaches. The price was worth the quality of this product since after heavy use it has no damage and it stays cold. Overall a definite BUY from us."
'5'.'0',It's really is an amazing product. It helps me sleep so much better but it does kinda hurt on the ears like a tiny bit but afterwards it fine,I have both eye pain from Thyroid eye and dry eye and migraines and Ive used them for both.  The fact that they are weighted improves the effect of the cold.
'5'.'0',This sleep mask is so nice! Really good quality and I especially love that it can be refrigerated/frozen,"I love this mask so much Ive bought it several times! This is the perfect weight to help with sleep and/or to help with my headache pain. I love to pop it in the freezer for a bit and then put it on. It feels so soothing and retains the cool for quite a long time! The strap is super easy to adjust, and its just adorable. When I get a headache I almost always get pressure around my eyes. This baby helps alleviate that so well! I lost my first one in a very unfortunate Im an idiot accident, and I knew I couldnt be without it so ordered a second time. Comes fast, doesnt have a funky smell, and is super helpful!"
'5'.'0',,"I love the material of this mask, doesn't seem too weighted so I'm anxious to try out tonight after chilling it"
'3'.'0',they are tiny and move around at night,Buy this. Instantly obsessed with it
'3'.'0',"These work good enough but the pockets inside are not as deep as the said and I wish I would have gotten the ones with the nose shield to keep out light better. The do still slide a little but I can deal with that. They are soft and comfortable, so far no other issues.","Best sleep mask I have ever had. I get migraines, so I needed something that was darkening and light weight. This one is great. The strap isnt to tight and u can adjust it. The weight is just right, heavy enough for sinus pain, but not heavy enough to add to a headache. U can also put it in the freezer and get it cold, it does not freeze. I have very long, natural eye lashes as well, the ""z"" print lets me open and close my eyes if I need to... just perfect for me all around. So glad I got this."
'3'.'0',Feel like swimming goggles,"the material is soft, and the issue is so tiny that at night as i toss and turn they move out of my eyes, and i wake up to move them into position a couple of times a night when light coming from outside wakes me up."
'3'.'0',I thought these were the same as Netflix Russian Doll version,"Product is different, lower quality over time"
'3'.'0',There's better versions out there,I saw the reviews and thought this should be perfect BUT it is not for side sleepers. The mask is so thick that is uncomfortable and it has to be wore very tight for the light not to come through. I am very disappointed with this product.
'3'.'0',They block the light!,"They are ok- the fabric is soft and they block the light well. however, I often wake in the night Feeling like I'm wearing a pair of swimming goggles. I prefer the sleep masks that are a flat piece of fabric. These have padding that is supposed to sit on the outer bony part of your eye socket, so nothing touches your eye ball. But they shift in the night and I end up with the padding pressed against my eye ball."
'3'.'0',Great design but needs better craftsmanship,"I thought I was buying the same ones pictured here from the Netflix series Russian Doll, but they are slightly different. Im not able to get the same fit as what I expected. I really like that I can open my eyes with the mask on. The fabric fiber makes very small stretching noises while I sleep. So they work but not as well as I would have hoped. From a sensory perspective, this could be improved but its still a great value for 2 pairs. Nice packaging. I am sure fabric is described somewhere but I dont always read details. I expected neoprene and its foam covered in something like spandex which us why you get the stretching noise."
'3'.'0',Not a nice fit around my eyes,"Depending on your eye mask experiences will depend on your critique of this item. I, however, had the cr??me de La cr??me of eye masks, which was similar to this but much better quality that I had received as a gift. Being a cheap ass, I saw the bundle of 3 thinking that these would be on par. Now, had I not experienced the top tier eye mask prior to this, I'd probably go 4 stars, but in comparison, these are cheap. I have a feeling they will deteriorate within months. They aren't nearly as comfortable, albeit comfortable enough. there's no cooling gel around the eyes, and overall just feels meh. I will use these, but will be spending money ($20/mask) on the better quality version of this mask in the futureThey do however block out all light so that's good!"
'3'.'0',,"These masks are a great price for 3, and once you get the fit settled they block light very well. My problem is they press ever so gently ony sinus cavities, and before the first hour of the night Im experiencing a sinus headache. So I havent worn them all night yet. The foam is soft, but its a little hot. I tried loosening the strap, but then they gapped or fell off. I dont think they are going to work for me."
'3'.'0',"Comfortable, But Not Very Effective","Update: having had these for 3 or 4 months, while I still love the design, the fabric is separating from the foam on the inner part (concave) facing the eyes. As such, it can now touch my eyes at times, and since avoiding that is one of the main features, they are not nearly as good once that happens. I can probably save them with a few stitches of thread near the center. Perhaps the company should consider adding something like that to the next version.Initial review: I have tried probably about 7 or 8 types of sleep mask, ranging from cheap to expensive, simple to a bit overdesigned, and these are the best ones yet for me. I like how the headband is adjustable but stays the way I set it. The mask is slightly cushioned, which is comfortable. It does a better job than most at blocking out light in the nose area. The shape of the mask is dimpled inward just enough to avoid pressing on your eyes.I am happy enough with these that I will probably buy more, even though I got three in this order."
'3'.'0',"This is the second time I purchased these. They work excellent out of the package.But after a couple months, the head strap elastic stretches out. You can adjust it, but it reaches a point where even that doesn't work.I guess that is ok, because around the same time the foam in the mask loses its shape. My eye lashes brushed against the mask waking me up again.As long as you expect to replace them every six months, they're good.","These sleep masks are really soft, but they do have a tendency to move around on my face at night. If you only want them to keep the light out, then they are pretty great. I got them because I have overly dry eyes and keep to keep moving air and debris away from my eyes while I sleep. There is not a great fit around my eyes, so I am waking up with my eyes dried out from the wind they are supposed to be protecting me from.Otherwise they are great masks."
'3'.'0',I suffer from headaches so I like total darkness! These let light in around the nose. I have a different brand that have more of a shell type cup these are just soft fabric. My other ones hug around my nose. Because these are a soft fabric they dont mold around your nose area leaving a gap for light to enter. They are thick enough that no light shines thru the fabric though. The strap loosens easily so Im not sure how it would be sleeping in it. Seems like mask would loosen and come off.,"The sleep mask I recently tried was a mixed bag. While it was comfortable to wear, I found that it wasnt very effective in helping me sleep.On the positive side, the sleep mask was very soft and comfortable to wear. The material was gentle on my skin and didnt cause any irritation or discomfort. The mask also fit well and stayed in place during the night, which was great.However, I found that the mask didnt block out light very well. It was marketed as a blackout mask, but I could still see light leaking in from the sides and bottom of the mask. This made it difficult to fall asleep, especially if youre sensitive to light.Another issue I had with the mask was that it didnt stay cool throughout the night. The material tends to trap heat, which can be uncomfortable, especially during the summer months.Overall, while the sleep mask was comfortable to wear, I wouldnt recommend it to those who are looking for a truly effective blackout mask. If youre a light sleeper who is sensitive to light, you may want to look for a mask that provides better light-blocking capabilities."
'3'.'0',Well made but they bulge out and they slipped off in the night.,Works fairly well for my CPAP mask (ResMed Airfit F20 full face mask)
'3'.'0',"The straps move around a lot when you sleep on your sides or back. When this happens, the grooves of the mask will sit on your eye and it's uncomfy. The holes don't always align with your eyes. These would only be perfect if they're used on a plane or if you're a back sleeper.",Not good if you like total darkness
'3'.'0',Definitely not Bucky brand,I just received my mask yesterday. Uncomfortable my mask kept coming off because of my hair. My hair is straight so it wont stay in place. The bands are too narrow. I tightened it all it did was make the eye cup smash my eyes.but I wish they worked nice around the outer part of the eye. But I think the cups need to be a little deeper.
'3'.'0',Light leak around your nose.,"Straps are uncomfy, but as expected"
'3'.'0',,"they simply werent large enough. the eye covering cup was smaller, and the length of the bike coverings in the front not including strap is not long enough. The mask I use from bed bath and beyond which are no longer available measured 9 "" the eye piece at widest part measured 3.5"". These mask measure 7 5/8"" x 3 1/8"".The strap is nicer than the old ones with  adjustable elastic. There is no Velcro. .I do not want to pull these really tight around my head, so these  just didnt work for me for those reasons only. I do not want to pull these really tight around my head. they are well-made and a good price, but too small."
'3'.'0',Nce coverage but very tight,"Because of the price difference I really wanted to like these. I have a pair of Bucky 40 Winks eyeshade and honestly, they are the bomb. These are not. As soon as I put them on and seated them on my face there was that cursed light leak around my nose. When I put on eye shades I expect instant inky blackness. Nothing else will do. Even after I adjust these to blackness if I so much as raise my eyebrows that damn light shows up again. I suspect these might work for smaller faces but I'm built like a linebacker and have a face to match so??back they go unfortunately. Now that my curiosity is satisfied I will happily pay for another pair of Buckys."
'3'.'0',Packaging was secure and interesting,"I've adjusted as much as possible but still light leaks around your nose.  I've washed them, so I'll keep them but would not recommend."
'3'.'0',Seems like decent quality but I didnt like this mask because of its odd fit. Its a bit small so either I have the puffy rim pressing against the bottom eyelid or if I pull it down its putting pressure on my nose. Id say I have a pretty average sized face! Could work for someone smaller.,"The eye covering is soft, pliable, provides good fit and good coverage, but the elastic back band at its loosest setting is still very, very tight on my quite average sized woman's head. I cut one and stitched an elastic insert into the original elastic band, and I am experimenting with 'stretching?? another of the 3 mask set, as elastic will eventually loosen as it is stretched over time.  I like the eye/face piece in each mask, and I can make them work with an adaption, but I was surprised at the extreme tightness of the elastic back band."
'3'.'0',"They aren't that great, I wore them for four nights to try and see if I'd get used to it but I barely slept for four nights in a row. Kept sliding around whenever I moved but if I tightened it I'd get a headache. You get what you pay for I guess","Material feels good and shape to keep off eyes but they are so much smaller than my previous ones that needed replacing.  As a side sleeper, the size is too small and lets light on and moves off my face too easily.  Since I missed the window for return I plan to keep them for airplane travel since they were inexpensive enough that if I lose them I wont be so sad."
'3'.'0',Very soft but nose piece does not stay molded well,"Odd size and shape, uncomfortable"
'3'.'0',"I like how soft and light weight they are.They claim it Perfectly matches your nose, it does not mine, no matter how tight i make it so no matter how i sleep, light comes through between my eye and nose.They also say its great for side sleepers, Im a side sleeper most nights and as soon as I roll on my side, no matter how tight it is, a lot of light comes in between the eye and nose.Ive definitely had better as far as light not coming in",Get what you pay for I guess lol
'3'.'0',"So many people said these truly were complete blackout even by the nose area. I was excited! Finally!I opened the package, adjusted for the size of my head and... light was coming thru the nose area!I repositioned and adjusted bur it was no use.I need complete blackout so that during a migraine I dont have to lie in bed with a blanket over my head to keep the light out.","Its comfortable when sleeping on side and I dont have any eye pressure but I wish the bridge was shorter.  For it to completely stay off the eyes, it puts pressure on bridge of nose."
'3'.'0',,Super soft & confortable but the nose piece tends to make the mask slip up during sleep. Still use  but can be frustrating in the middle of the night slipping up
'2'.'0',Extension wearers beware!,Dont quite live up to the hype.
'2'.'0',"Buckles on the side, bad design",The price is good for three masks but I don't love the fit. The masks are very padded but not very contoured so they lay against my eyes but also leave gaps for light around my nose. I sleep on my stomach/side so they move around a bit. They might be better for a back sleeper. I will keep looking for a better fit.
'2'.'0',"This let light in. And when I tighten it to where it did not let light in, left sores on my ears. The strap is not comfortable and tangled in my hair (when it was in a bun). This product might work best for a male. Or someone with a larger head and shorter hair.","I bought these masks to protect my eyelash extensions while I sleep. They looked exactly as advertised out of the package, however during use, the round part over the eyes creased horizontally across the mask, making the material lay directly on my eyes. Literally the exact opposite of what they are advertised to do. They look nice but are cheaply made and very flimsy."
'2'.'0',I bought these for travelling to Europe.  I hoped (and thought) that the description was accurate and that the area over the eyes were distended enough so that my eyelashes wouldnt be smooshed.  There is no hope of preserving my make,The buckles on the sides for the straps are uncomfortable & a bad design. I returned them
'2'.'0',"I returned these almost immediately because the fit was so bad. In order for them to fit snugly, I had to tighten the headband which caused the mask to gap and allow light to beam directly onto my eyes. They were soft though.",Some people like these. Not sure why. I guess they do keep out the light but the material is not comfortable at all. I usually buy silk sleep masks but wanted to give these a try just for the heck of it. Threw them out after a few uses. Going back to my usual silk ones. So much more comfortable.
'2'.'0',"Ive purchased different types of these masks in the past. These ones arent the best. The bubble area for your eyes is really thick and high so when I lay on my side, it concaves in and presses on my eyeball defeating the purpose.",Eye socket area presses against eyelashes
'2'.'0',,"These are ok for the price, but light still comes n around the nose so this would be best used in a less lighted space."
'2'.'0',Uncomfortable and light gets in,Disappointing!!! The mask creases in the middle right across my eyelids. The elastic slips and the pieces holding the elastic to the mask become very uncomfortable and hurt behind my ears. I plan to return these. I do not recommend them.
'2'.'0',Ive purchased multiple times. I do not recommend the new version.,"I am very disappointed with this sleep mask.  It is NOT 100% blackout.  It does not adequately shut out light no matter how I adjust the strap.  Also, the contour eye area is not high enough to avoid my eye lashes from brushing against the material and eye makeup gets all over it.  There are better eye masks out there like Bucky sleep masks.  Would not recommend this mask."
'2'.'0',I like them as they help me sleep but  the strap is way loose no and I have only worm it or a little over a week.,The eye mask seems so promising. It would probably be OK if you were on a plane sitting predominantly upright and would be helpful if you had make up on to protect it. I did not like it. I use an eye mask almost every morning and this one just did not work for me is it let in light.
'2'.'0',"For my particular face shape, they did not really fit, and light seeped around the nose bridge. Ill keep them for emergency use, but otherwise, I couldnt use them. On the other hand a friend liked them just fine so she got two of them.",I purchased a few years ago and then again a few weeks ago. They are worlds different! The new one is stiff and bunches/pushes too much around the top of nose. :(
'2'.'0',,i have worn it for a little over a week and the strap is too loose.  It stresses out fast
'2'.'0',Likes: Blocks out most light. Inexpensive.  Eyecups do not  delaminate like some eye masks.  Elastic band with small metal clip is better than thick overlapping velcro straps for back,Did not fit my face properly
'2'.'0',"I bought them for deeper eye cups and 100% light blockage.  These do neither.  Very flat eye cups and gaps around both sides of the nose.  You cannot blink your eyes when the mask is on without vyour eyelids and lashes against the mask, which to me is a sign of SHALLOW eye cups.  They come packaged in a FLAT, vacuum","The mask shifts around every time I move, even when tight"
'2'.'0',"I have been using the black one for a little over a week, maybe two weeks and I am not pleased with it.1. Yes it is soft2. Light comes in under the lower eyes and around the nose3. The strap slips of my head during the night and I wake up looking for the mask4. If I tighten it so it doesn't skip off the the back of my head the (bra looking eye cups) push into my eyes",Wears out quickly. Could use better design and material.
'2'.'0',,Misleading photos and descriptions
'2'.'0',Technically works but very uncomfortable,Keep looking- pay a little more for better quality
'2'.'0',The part the cover the eyes is structurally to soft. The bubble eye cover breaks down super easy from accidentally sitting on it to if your head is bigger it stretches the covering send flattens it. Same for if you sleep on the side of your face.Also the part that holds the elastic band is poorly constructed as it flips because it is not made to securely hold that band on the plastic loop,"1. Theyre rigid, so they dont quite cut out the light from the sides, which is pretty important2. The band is right in the middle, so it either goes right above your ears or over your ears, meaning its uncomfortable in any case, and you cant tighten too much (which would help problem #1)"
'2'.'0',"Ive had these eye masks for nearly a month now; and after trial and error, I have to stop using them. These are thin and not","It technically works in that it blocks out light and doesnt place any pressure on the eyeballs. However, it is uncomfortable in every other aspect. The material is a little bit rough and very irritating on the skin, especially if it is dry. It doesnt place any pressure on the eyeballs, but it places a lot of pressure on the outline of the mask which is uncomfortable. And itll easily shift around your face if you move your cheeks around at all."
'2'.'0',If you want to have something fall apart in your sleep best product to get first one I grabbed in the first day of using it the band is already shredded going to try the next one hopefully it's just the one that's bad,Sliders in the wrong place for side sleepers
'2'.'0',"I tend to sleep on my side with my face half buried in the pillow. That causes the 3D part of this to put pressure on my eye. Not good IMO. It can also allow light to leak in around the nose. Ive gone back to larger, flat mask and am happy I did.","One of the more uncomfortable sleep masks I've ever purchased. The bubbled out effect on the eyes results in increased pressure around the eyes. It ends up creating a very uncomfortable sensation no matter how the band is adjusted. When you roll onto your side, the eye area ends up getting pushed in and creates an awkward, wrinkled sensation. Overall light blocking coverage is good though. I wear this one in a pinch, but will have to purchase something more comfortable for every day use."
'2'.'0',Good concept; bad execution,"This looks like a little bra, but does not fit like one. I am looking for a blackout mask that blocks all light, doesnt leave marks in the morning, doesnt turn to the side at night, and you wont have to tighten mask down.This mask lets light in, leaves marks, turns to the side at night and has to be super tight to even be close to effective.Move on from this one."
'2'.'0',,Not a fan of the 3D part
'2'.'0',"Was nice at first, but quickly flattened out","As a personal preference I use domed eye masks so they don't actually touch my eyes.  I've bought others on Amazon which did that. I thought these would be the same, they're not.  Once you go to tighten the adjustable strap, the tension cause the dome around the eye to fold and make eye contact with your eye lid.  Absolute deal breaker.  If you like that, maybe not so bad, but these don't hold the shape they're supposed to."
'2'.'0',"Strap.isnt in the right place for my liking. Have to push it up towards the crown of my head so strap.wont bother my ears but that adds pressure below my eyes. My 5 yr old loves them so,gave them to him. Good at blocking out light and soft though","The fabric part of these masks is softer than anything Ive ever tried. They are barely big enough to cover my eyes, but do a pretty good job of keeping artificial light out. The drawback is the strap. As you tighten the clip, it gets moved to bad spots around my head and if I lie on the side its on--I wake up with a SPLITTING headache and have to take it off.They need to redesign this so that the clip doesnt press into your head while youre sleeping. If they can figure out how to do that then I might consider buying them again."
'2'.'0',"You have to put on your face in a very specific way for light to not come through, which is a problem when it moves even slightly. Often when you toss and turn at night, it will move around and light will end up slipping through. I tried fixing this by making sure the strap was on tight, but it simply didnt work and made it uncomfortable.","I bought these a few months ago and have been using them. They were nice at first and I liked that it didnt press against my eyes. But, after two months, Ive managed to wear down all three somehow. They are basically flat and the ""eye contouring"" is gone.The straps are too low for me and bother my ears, but I tend to find most eye masks do so probably dont listen to me about that lol. Honestly, if not for it touching my ears, I dont notice it or the buckle. But, I do have a lot of hair in the way, so Im not sure?"
'2'.'0',I like the material,Deforms too easily and puts pressure on the eyes
'2'.'0',Doesnt quite meet the mark,The mask moving slightly will allow light to get through
'2'.'0',Looses All Structure When Washed :(,"100% comfortable, does not keep light out properly."
'2'.'0',"Small which is a plus, but falls off in the night","While these were comfortable to sleep in, they fell apart very quickly. Most of them ripped at the seam in the nose section within a month of using them. I hand-washed one, and the foam around the eyes deformed. the other two I wiped with a damp hand towel to clean after that. Helpful in a pinch, but the quality isnt worth the savings. I recommended paying extra for one that is well made."
'2'.'0',,"This mask generally okay if using at night. For daytime sleeping lots of light gets in. I am a nightshift worker and use a mask to sleep during the day. Even little bits of light will throw my sleep patten off. The construction is flimsy. This means light leakage and that mask easily move out of place, i.e., off the eyes. Tightening is the about the only tool to fix these problems but, tightening mask so far as to block out light and hold firmly over eyes which then it is too tight and will touch the eyes. This is another annoyance that prevents easy sleep.For night time these do good to block out little lights while maintaining a comfortable adjustment. Not so much for the daytime when window drapes and other contraption cant stop all the sunlight."
'2'.'0',Annoying crease in the center,"You cannot put these in a mesh laundry bag or hand wash, the structure of the eye sockets just droops down and they are very irritating when you wear them. I want to be able to wash these since they go on my face and especially near my eyes. For that reason, this product is not suitable for cleanliness. I am not sure how it has gotten so many stars and no complaints about keeping it clean. I cant use these anymore."
'2'.'0',Not great if you are going to wear them all night and you need perfect darkness,"The idea is good: the mask does not touch the eyes. For me, the single strap is ineffective; masks I have brought from airlines usually have two straps (lightweight elastic bands), they stabilize the mask from above and below the ears. The single strap must be placed only above or below the ears, and in such a position, the mask slips up or down. It is good that the strap can be adjusted, but it is either too tight (gives a headache) or too loose (lets in light)."
'2'.'0',"Masks are thin and the light entered around the bridge of nose.  When I tightened the strap, the flat top layer laid against my eye lids [not very comfortable especially if I blinked under the mask].  Just felt cheap and flimsy in comparison to my last mask made by MZOO.  I tried to save a few dollars, not to mention get three mask for the price of one.  What a mistake.  Trying another version made by Unimi that arrives tomorrow.  In the end, I immediately without reservation asked to return the mask.  On a final note, I have a big head [literally].  These also felt too small.  Subsequently a person with a small head might find them a better fit.  Nevertheless, the quality, density and overall feel of the product is just plain ""cheap.""","These masks looked promising until I put them on and noticed the crease in the center which causes the cup to collapse into your eye.  With proper positioning, it works for me but I only need them for the 1-2 hours of daylight I sleep during. I imagine someone who tries to get a full 8-hour sleep in the daytime will find themselves adjusting frequently.  They are very soft, the strap is comfortable and the price is great.  Its a shame the design of the cup fails.  My guess is the crease allows you to flip up the bottom portion to see instead of needing to lift the whole mask up.  That is convenient, unfortunately at the expense of comfort and usability."
'2'.'0',You get what you pay for,Not great if you are going to wear them all night and you need perfect darkness.They are to flimsy to work well.
'2'.'0',"Ive purchased many sleeping masks like this. I love the idea of the shape that doesnt smoosh your eyelashes. This is a pack of three. There is one main one that is built better than the rest. It's a little thicker and is shaped better. The other two have this odd crease line gong through the eye area and this allows the cup to have a tighter, flatter strip. This is uncomfortable across the eye. Also, this allows the cup to sit incorrectly across the face and allows light around the edges. I threw away the two with the odd strip. I will not buy this brand again.","Three might equal one; however, I still sent it back"
'2'.'0',the elastic wears out and they go completely flat in about 2 weeks of use. nice before that.,The foam form leaves gaps and then the mask slides. Rather annoying instead of restful.  Also poor ventilation despite the gaps and waking caused by discomfort.
'2'.'0',Doesnt blackout light,"I honestly didnt have high hopes given how cheap they were for a set of 3 but i needed backups for when i wash my good one, these literally feel liks a bra w no underwire on my face, gaps around the nose, looks like its padded around the eyes but its not, its the same thickness all around and as soon as you put them on even loose fitting the eyes cave in like when youre wearing a bra thats cup size is too big for you defeating the whole purpose of the cups for the eyes... needless to say as a night shift worker i need a mask that can help me sleep during the day, these aint it"
'2'.'0',,nice at first...doesnt last 2 weeks
'2'.'0',Does not stay on all night,cant be too loose or to tight
'2'.'0',I couldn't keep these. I'm not sure how anyone can use them. They smell like a Chinese sweat shop factory. Inhaling that all night would be awful. Came nicely packaged,"Cute colors, super soft fabric, good stitching that doesnt come loose like other sleep masks. It also has eye compartments that dont press down on your eyes as you sleep. And, no velcro closing! So no hair snagging which is great. Most sleep masks have velcro closures which snags hair or your bonnets/hair scarves if you wear them.CONS- doesnt blackout light. they cover my eyes but it doesnt get completely black and I think thats because of the fabric. also, the nose area doesnt fit perfectly, and light gets through there as well.- doesnt stay on. I find myself readjusting it in the middle of the night or Ill touch my face and wonder where it went and then see it on my pillow.- is not rigid, as some other reviewers have stated. if you want to wear it tight, the whole mask will collapse in the middle and hurt your eyes. so unfortunately, you can only wear it loose.I dont recommend these. Try the Bucky brand instead, they rule."
'2'.'0',Wears outs after a few months. Gets gross quickly.,Fits fine. Mostly blocks out light. Does not stay on your face at night
'2'.'0',Not a one size fits all product,"The mask on the top is this product, the bottom one is another brand (for comparison). This size is not appropriate for a man, maybe a woman. If you move your eyes or forehead, or rest your head sideways, the smallest movement misalign the mask off your eyes, allowing the light to reach your eyes. Wouldnt recommend."
'2'.'0',"Runs small, leaks light",They move when you move. Too tight on my eyes. Returned.
'2'.'0',They poke into my eyes,"These dont block 100% of the light, but they do block most of it. It wore out much more quickly than expected (only lasted a few months before a seam split). But it got fairly gross after wearing it for a while. I suppose I could have laundered it more frequently. But I dont feel like laundering it more frequently than I wash my bedsheets. Ive switched back to a cotton bandana blindfold."
'2'.'0',Big downgrade from the previous design,I had high hopes for these sleep masks but they should have don't fit. The width of my face is larger than what is comfortable for these masks. I tried stretching it out and it didn't work. If you have a larger face I would skip this brand.
'2'.'0',Soft & Lightweight but flawed,These sleep masks are definitely on the small side compared to others I have bought in the past and so leak more light than others Ive used. Quality is pretty average.
'2'.'0',,"I dont really see how these are for side sleepers. They arent spaced right or something, and they poke into my eyes."
'2'.'0',I can tell if the lights are on.,"This is my second time buying this item, but the previous version had much deeper 'cups?? over the eyes which kept your eyelashes from getting smashed against your face. The new version has the same material (which is nice and soft) but they made the whole thing almost flat for some reason and now I can't even wear it for more than a minute. Why change what worked?"
'2'.'0',"These face masks are junk. They have rough ""melted"" seams that will feel scratchy on your cheeks and the elastic band is garbage. Theres other pairs equal in price that have nice, sewn seams with higher quality straps. Avoid these.","These get a star for being soft, lightweight, with a nice adjustable strap and another star for the great price. Unfortunately they fell short on everything else. The 'deep eye room?? they state is not even close to the one I currently have. My eyelashes and eyelids touch the inside of the cup area. Which is not comfortable and I can't imagine wearing it all night, having it resting on my eyelids which then make your eyelids smoosh against your eyeballs. I cannot imagine how my eyes would feel in the morning after a night of that. If I loosen the band more then the mask slides around and more light comes through the nose area. Speaking of nose area they also don't do a good job of blocking the light from coming through around there either.I had high hopes from all the good reviews, but I will be returning these and reordering the one I am currently using."
'2'.'0',Product gave me chemical burns,I've had other eye masks that blocked out light to the point I would not know if the lights are on. These do not. I would give them an 7/10 in blocking lights. They also have to sit just right to not let light in around the nose. Any small movement of your head may move them out of place.
'2'.'0',"I got these sleep masks after I left my usual one at home. The eye 'wells?? are not big enough and the eye part is not aligned correctly with the nose notch ' it kept slipping up on my head so that it didn't cover my eyes, even after adjusting it several times. I would buy the Bucky brand sleep masks over this any day. Don't waste your money on this.",I am work night shift so need masks that cover my face. These leak light underneath my eyes. Would be great for travel but not for day sleeping.
'2'.'0',"No matter how I adjusted the strap tension, the mask would slide up my face so the bottom part of mask would be sitting directly on my eyes and not block out light. Uncomfortable and defeated the whole purpose. Soft material, but overall useless as a sleep mask.","I have bought from this company 3 or 4 times before and loved the eye Masks I received. However, the Masks sent with me recent order are different than the ones I received in the past and are a much inferior product. I am terribly unhappy. The crease across the eye is very annoying and even the adjustable head strap is inferior. After only two nights of wear, it now has this  warped fold in the strap that makes it uncomfortable and rolled while wearing it. Lastly, the new design does not block light as well and I think it maybe because the face piece is smaller. They probably kept the same amount of fabric and then when they added the annoying 3D cups it took away from the fabric actually available on the face.Ill be going back to my old beat up one until I can find a new company that sells the quality Im looking for in a sleep mask. I definitely wont be ordering from this company again."
'2'.'0',Too tight and not adjustable,"Yup. You read the headline correctly.After wearing the black mask for about 15ish minutes, the skin that was in contact with the mask became seriously inflamed & burned.Ive since washed the sleep masks three times; it seems to have solved the problem. Still: I woudnt recommend these to anyone. Theyre not so comfortable as to be worth chemical burns.ON EDIT: Got a message from vendor:""Thank you for your purchase and taking the time to write a product review.We are so sorry about all the inconvenience caused by the product. This is an extremely rare case.The sleep mask Plastic bags have an unpleasant chemical smell.

I wont be asking for a refund, and Im not particularly upset - just want to warn folks that if you buy these masks: WASH THEM FIRST or you risk hurting yourself."
'2'.'0',,"The only thing I liked was the texture of the material. I ordered a set right before this one that did not block out light completely. I ordered these the same day that I returned the others. I open up my new ones and they are The EXACT Same ones! Same exact silver sealed envelope, wording, packaging exact same. Since they are the same, they Do Not completely block out light, they are not tapered to curve around the outside of the eye or nose. I will just spend the $ on (hopefully) one's that give measurements and contour properly."
'5'.'0',I like the ability to adjust the mask to fit me.  It successfully blocks out light enabling me to get to sleep and stay asleep.,"Design great, stays in place however followed directions handwashed prior to first use with mild detergent and ended up with chemical burn around eyes for 5 days. Awful. Material does not breathe and is not good for your delicate skin. If they could somehow I corporate 100% silk with this design would be perfect."
'5'.'0',Meets the need perfectly!,The blindfold part is great but the strap is very tight and is not adjustable.  My 5 yr old is the only one small enough to use it
'5'.'0',"The fit is very comfortable and the eye pockets are perfect in aiding in that comfort. They blackout well, are soft with foam cushion and adjustable strap. I find that even aid in opening my nasal passages making it easier on my sinuses.  Definitely recommend.","These become soft and fluffy and thick feeling after washing. I sleep wonderfully when I do use them. The tie around the head dont bother me and adjusts perfectly. Ive washed them once and rarely use them though, so Im not sure about how well theyll hold up after a couple more uses. Ill update if anything changes."
'5'.'0',I really like the softness and its ability to keep the light out.,"As a day-sleeper, it can be difficult to keep the room dark enough. This mask works perfectly without pressing on the eyelids,"
'5'.'0',When I woke up I thought I was dead because of the darkness this item have gift me with!,Im a light sensitive sleeper so I thought Id try these as it wasnt a large investment. After adjusting the elastic band it was very comfortable and very effective at blocking light. Very happy so far.
'5'.'0',,"I love these! The strap is adjustable which is useful and helpful. The ergonomics are good as well. My nose is not irritated from friction because there is none. The pads block out lights really well too! I am able to throw them in the washer, they come out clean and fresh. The colors are nice, material is comfortable. I will be ordering more!"
'2'.'0',"I first ordered these sleep masks May 2018 for me and my 2 sons, and Ive ordered them several times since when the old ones started to wear out. Each time I reorder, they send me different sleep masks. But they always worked great so I kept going to the ""buy again"" section.Recently my oldest son needed a new sleep mask and my wife ordered them. The sleep masks were too small and the edges of the mask were right on our eyes. I thought she ordered childrens sleep masks by mistake, so I went to the ""buy again"" section and reordered these. Again, we got small masks that only fit my 8","I  got these because  I  recently  had hip replacement surgery  and I  go to bed before hubby, it works great for blocking  the TV light and such...an they are so soft and do not sit directly  on the eyes...colors are great also"
'2'.'0',Not good for sleeping,"Very light weight, adjustable and blocks out light.  Efficient.."
'2'.'0',Not for side sleepers,"The product is fine for a child maybe.  Size is way too small for a male adult.  Padding is half of premium competitors.  Its priced accordingly at ~$5/ea compared to 20-35 for competitors.  Spend accordingly, sleep is something you can never get back."
'2'.'0',"Nice quality, very well made. Like almost all the others the head band is placed too low on the sides and it rides up on your nose. Thereby leaking light . . .yes my ears are in the right place.",It comes off completely
'2'.'0',I prefer these kind of 3D,Light comes in around the edges of the mask. Mask shifts around while asleep .
'2'.'0',These are fine when you first put them on but they slip up on your head. It's just slightly but there's zero room for movement or the light pours in. I've tried everything to try to get the mask to stay but haven't been able to.,"Seem to be well made, but not good for side sleepers. Too padded."
'2'.'0',"I purchased these eye bras because I thought they were the same size as the ones I had purchased over the last few years, dark blue with gold moon and stars. I also figured I had a deal being that there were three for less than the price of one. They werent the same. These are much smaller and would be great for little kids or a small adult. My eyelashes get caught in the small depressed area. My blue/gold moon and stars mask had a depressed area over twice the size as my eye.I already washed all three masks and threw away the packaging or I would return them. Now I have to go find the dark blue ones and buy those again. On the plus side, they are soft and do not smell funny.",Not as comfortable as other sleeping masks
'2'.'0',"Sorry, detailed below. Tldr; older versions of this mask were 5 stars, quality has noticably decreased and the price is higher with the current offering only which deserves 2","The are good at their job, but the strap gets stretched out quickly and it doesnt stay on as you shift positions in your sleep, in a matter of days! No wonder you get 3.. Would be a 5 star product if the strap held its shape."
'2'.'0',These kinda suck compared to my normal sleep masks. They do not black out all the light and are less comfortable. I would try a different mask! These are being returned. I recommend the 3D Deep Contoured Eye Covers for Sleeping they are wayyyy better,Great for Little Kids or adults with small heads and eyes
'2'.'0',"I needed to replace the ones my wife gave me and that I lost in a trip. The previous ones were covered in silk, and they were also very soft and adaptable (they fit both my wifes smaller face and mine without any major adjustments), but I didnt want to go fancy.Long","First the positive, they are soft and they do block the light.However, there is no way I would ever be able to sleep with these extremely uncomfortable things strapped around my head.Way too tight at the loosest setting. Strap is uncomfortable above the ears, below the ears, and on the ears. The mask touches both eyes, so it is necessary to hold both eyes tightly shut when wearing mask. Even though the strap is excessively tight the mask moves all over my face. In that respect it is truly 3d as it moves left-right, up-down, and in-out. This happens on both sides, on my back, and on my stomach.They did contribute to about 6 hours of restful sleep last night. I was so exhausted after attempting to use these the last 2 nights that when I took it off in the middle of the night I was able to sleep with lights in my eyes."
'2'.'0',These are not complete black,The concave pocket for the eye is not as deep as shown
'2'.'0',"""Reordered "" what Amazon said was the SAME product that I had previously purchased, the top mask in the picture. What I received was the bottom mask that does not fit as good as the old style. It leaks light and my eyelashes touch the mask, and Im an 82 year old male. Im going to try and return them but I followed the instructions and washed the bottom pair.",Theyre great if you dont have a nose
'2'.'0',"Ive ordered in the past, but when I ordered a replacement this time (June, 2023), the design of the eye masks have changed, so that the center, cupped diameter","I loved their previous model eye shades because they were large with deep eye cups. I just ordered more and unfortunately the new versions are smaller with shallow eye cups. What are these....MASKS FOR ANTS?! I looked around Amazon for other sellers and they ALL use this newer, smaller version. I guess ita true what they say, ""all good things come to an end eventually""...sigh."
'2'.'0',,Product changed from last purchase
'5'.'0',Love the heaviness and the indent of the eyes,Product has changed and not as good as it used to be
'5'.'0',"Feels nice, great weight.",I have had better. This item is not Velcro and hard to adjust. They do not come away from the eyes as described and there are gaps so light comes through There are better ones out there and this is not it.
'5'.'0',This mask is very comfortable and love how it feels on my face. Very cool and stays on even while sleeping. Mask is very adjustable to any size.,Excellent to help those who struggle to sleep.  I am a chronic insomniac and this helps.
'5'.'0',The material is very soft. I love the adjustable strap. Looking forward to using it after it's been cooled on a hot day.,I bought two of these! One for myself and one for a friend who suffers from severe migraines. Both of us have found relief using this. Glass weighted beads stay cold longer than gel. The stitches in the eyes allow gentle pressure for migraines.
'5'.'0',"I used for sinus headaches, works great warm or cold.",This feels amazing. Cool and comfortable.
'5'.'0',Great product. The materials it is made of is very soft and comfortable . I love how it is weighted and stays cool for a some time. I will be getting another one soon.,These are the best for getting rid of night light and eye protection to prevent swelling.
'5'.'0',"This eye mask is very comfortable, and I do like the cooling properties of the material.  The weight of it is soothing, and not excessive.  The band is easily adjusted, and I appreciate that there is no velcro (which always pulls my hair!), and that the band is smooth, almost like a bra strap, if that makes sense.  I have washed this in a lingerie bag, and laid flat to dry, with no issues.  Im pleased with how much light this blocks, and feel that it improves my sleep quality.",This works great for my migraine and veer soft and comfortable
'5'.'0',Soothing and comfortable to wear,Great product. Very comfortable
'5'.'0',"Your eyes will feel heavy with these on, which will help them remain closed to sleep longer. Darkness and silence are needed for a good rest or nap.","I wanted a weighted mask that would help reduce the puffiness in my eyes I typically have when I wake up. This worked great. Not only do I feel refreshed, but I can see a small improvement in my under eye bags. I like the adjustable head strap, however the small plastic buckle was a bit uncomfortable at first. I had to find the right position for it to not be noticeable."
'5'.'0',"Umisleep Weighted Eye Mask, Cooling Sleep Mask",The adjustable strap on this mask makes it comfortable to wear. It stays cool and the weight helps to relieve pressure in my sinuses so I can rest.
'5'.'0',"I really like this mask it's very comfortable to sleep in. My eyes feel well rested in the morning, and I have less swelling.",A face mask for your eyes only!
'5'.'0',"Its soft, and not too heavy, comfortable.",I ordered this to use when traveling as I have trouble sleeping away from home. This works perfect to block light out. It is not too heavy and fits nicely. It is not uncomfortable to wear.
'5'.'0',,I wear a mask everynight to bed but never a weighted one. Looking forward to wearing it tonight.
'5'.'0',Helps with Migraines!,"I have had many masks that work for a few months and then the head band gets so stretched out you cant wear it anymore. This one is like a bra strap, hook it when you get it on your face. So nice and heavy. Very soft material.  I tried it and there is absolutely no light that shines in!!! I fall asleep fast with this on. Just enough pressure under the eyes to really relax me.  I have MS, Migraines and horrible anxiety. This mask is a powerful tool for me.  I am in love with it and so thankful I got it as an early Christmas present!! Highly recommend!!"
'5'.'0',This product has helped me sleep better than I thought I would. Can't sleep without it now.,I have only used one night but so far so good!
'5'.'0',"Eye mask gets cold, soothes headaches. Great way to relax eyes and soothe head pressure.","I bought this for my daughter, she has terrible migraines?? she said it has helped so much!"
'5'.'0',"I slept well wearing this mask. It shields my eyes from all streetlight/ambient lighting, and it's a great value for a weighted eye mask. The weight is pleasant for everyday sleep and definitely something I'd reach for when a migraine strikes (both the darkness and the pressure will help).  You can adjust the strap for a good fit, but it's designed in such a way that hair won't get tangled in it. Also, the glass beads will need a little help with orientation. The core part of the mask is basically a bag sewn shut, with small contoured places for the eyes to keep out the beads. As a result, the beads freely flow in the outer part of the mask. I just shifted the beads around for even coverage across the entire mask, but if I had a migraine rooted in just one eye, I could easily shift the beads to add more weight to the affected area.","This mask provides great relief from sore, itchy eyes."
'5'.'0',,It also helps with sinus pressure.
'5'.'0',Perfect fitted weighted mask,"Hello, darkness & sweet relief"
'5'.'0',Perfect soothing sleep mask!,This mask works perfect. It doesn't get super cold just cool enough to feel great on your eyes. It is weighted with little beads inside which helps hold it in place on your face. It also has an adjustable band that goes around your head to keep it on. I personally don't like having stuff like that around my head when trying to sleep however this band was very comfortable and I verily noticed that it was on. I really like this mask and highly recommend it.
'5'.'0',Super mask for headaches or stress,Love the weight and fit of this mask!
'5'.'0',Great product from what I can see.,This product is very comfortable and soothing to wear!! I bring with me when I travel too!
'5'.'0',Love how it is weighted,So soothing for irritated eyes.
'5'.'0',,"It's freezer safe. Also, adjustable strap is and inch thick"
'5'.'0',Good for sleep and headaches,Very nice materials. Doesn't stay cold long.
'5'.'0',Fantastic for Migraines,works wonder for my sleep.
'5'.'0',Works well. Buy two so you can alternate and always have a cold one,Works great after I put in freezer for head ackes
'5'.'0',Came fast and as described.,I get horrible excruciating migraine headache and I use these on my eyes and forehead
'5'.'0',Nicely constructed weighted mask,A good cold mask for headaches
'5'.'0',,Great quality soft and I can't wait to use it! Came in a cute package super adorable.
'5'.'0',I bought it for my husband. He often has headaches and has trouble sleeping. He feels the weight and texture of the mask helped him to relax and sleep well.,Cant wait to try it.
'5'.'0',"Great product, comfortable and helps my husband sleep better.  Im asleep in minutes!","Looks well constructed, and not too heavy. should be great for my migrains"
'5'.'0',Very well made. Comfortable to use. Would buy again.,"This has been a god send. I have frequent headaches and this it's so soothing and gets cold quickly. I had one that broke and could never find the silky material, but here it is!"
'5'.'0',The mask is really comfortable and the weight is just right.,Love the weight of the mask and good construction.
'5'.'0',One of the best masks I have used,Put it in the freezer for a great way to help relieve migraines
'5'.'0',I work nights an this is the best thing for me. Nice an cool and makes it dark so I can fall asleep with ease.,I like the way it is made with no pressure on the eyeball. It is soothing and doesn't press on the eyeball.
'5'.'0',,I like the weight of the mask on my face. Doesn't bother my eyes at all. Coolness is comforting
'5'.'0',"Im a trucker driver with sleep apnea. I use a cpap machine when I sleep and mostly sleep only during the day, as i drive through the night. This mask has been so helpful. It doesnt interfere with my cpap mask, blocks out every bit of light, and afte5 putting it in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes, it feels so good on my eyes. I fall straight to sleep and its a deep solid REM sleep. I feel so much better and rested when I wake up. It even helps when I want to try and fall back to sleep after going to the bathroom.",I use a CPAP machine and this helps stop air from going into my eyes.
'5'.'0',I use this along with another cold pack for migraine headache.  I use this one on my forehead and the other one to the back of head; which can fit under the strap of the first.  Is very helpful.,"I had ordered this product in the hopes it would help my headaches go away, and its by far the best product I have ever bought. I sleep so comfortable at night headache free!"
'5'.'0',"So cozy and comfortable! Stays cold for quite awhile. I also like the weight of it and the flexible strap. I put it in forehead when I had a headache and that helped, too.",great for migraine headaches
'5'.'0',Great eye mask for stress relief,"I bought it because I have a medical condition that can cause my corneas to scratch or tear on their own. When that happens, one of the only things to help with the pain is pressure - BUT my eyes are also very sensitive to touch. Rubbing my eyes can be incredibly painful.This mask is the perfect amount of weight to soothe my cornea pain and not hurt my eyes.AND I have trouble falling asleep and noticed it happens much faster on the nights I use the mask."
'5'.'0',"works as intended, keeps my face nice and cool when trying to get some sleep while also keeping a nice amount of pressure on my eyes.","??I love this mask! It keeps my face cool and because its weighted, it helps me sleep more soundly! It is also made very well and has an adjustable strap. I would definitely buy this again."
'5'.'0',,These are perfect to have in the freezer for migraines.  So comforting.
'5'.'0',"I love these. They are so comfortable and even with my migraines they don't cause enough pressure to stress my headache, which is a problem I've had with other sleep masks. They're so great I had to order another set because my children each wanted one and now they sleep with them","I was looking for an eye mask to use when I meditate before bed or when Im napping. This is perfect as the weight of the mask almost feels like an accupressure massage on the face. I was initially worried that the stitched ""V""s for the eye sockey wouldnt be enough to prevent the weighted beads from putting pressure on my eyes, but it actually works great at putting pressure on everywhere besides the eyes."
'5'.'0',Best eye masks I've used,Havent tried it yet but it looks great! Well made. They ask you to review for a free gift
'5'.'0',I have been using the same one blue sleep mask since 2020,These eye mask are super comfortable and  lock all light. The cushion on the inside is soft yet firm to do its job. The mask are well made with good quality material.
'5'.'0',Ive tried a handful of different sleep masks. These are the best. Hands down. Comfortable and lightweight. They look a little odd shape but thats because you can open your eyes with these on comfortably. Especially recommend for women with long lashes who are worried about eye masks affecting those. I will never buy another eye mask on than these again!,"I have been sleeping with a mask for years now and tried every kind! This is my favorite, it stays on and fits tightly over my eyes. This is my second set!"
'5'.'0',I'm a night shift nurse and these are the only thing that works to help me sleep thru the day time! They don't squish my eyeballs and o just rotate and throw them in the wash weekly.,"I just placed another order for LKY sleep masks.  I've tried others, but none compare to these.  They conform to your face providing a convex space for your eyes so the fabric doesn't touch your eyes. I have purchased others over the years, but these are the most comfortable, block out the light completely, and the adjustable band stays in place without pressure. Best of all there's no Velcro to get caught in your hair or make crinkly noises. I have several available as I like to hand wash them occasionally and always take a couple for travel or just in case. Highly recommend!!"
'5'.'0',"I love the way these masks have an adjustable strap and how they block out the light and have space between the mask and the eyes.Use of eye masks result in an increased amount of REM sleep and less time spent between falling asleep and reaching REM sleep.Wearing an eye mask during sleep can improve alertness the next day. Sleep is crucial for alertness and for preparing the human brain to encode new information.I found this information online but I have experienced waking up feeling refreshed, more alert and having better reflexes. When you sleep, even though your eyes are closed, light can still seep through, which can disturb your rest.Do not use these only for travel, but for everyday use. Keep one in your purse or briefcase. It's amazing how one can feel relaxing with an eye mask.",No pressure on the nose area (which I appreciate!) and still keeps light out! I can also open my eyes and my lashes do not rub against the mask. Great product!
'5'.'0',Weighted masks are the way to go!,Perfect for night shift
'5'.'0',Relieved my burning eyes and helps me fall asleep.,Love these eye masks!
'5'.'0',My daughter cannot sleep without it. Makes her sleep good.,"This is now my favorite type of sleep mask - weighted! I have a few others, but this one is my fav. The ""beads"" conform to your eyes & the weight puts pressure on your eyes which feels so good when my eyes are tired or if I have a slight headache. This mask is great for side sleeping. It does not dig into the side of my head, keeps the light out very well, even sleeping on your side. Only issue I have is that the strap on the back keeps coming off its hook when I take the mask off. It does not come apart when Im sleeping. Just something that happens when I take it off, so not a big deal. Havent tried to freeze or frigerate the mask, so cant attest to that benefit. I have a liquid filled freezable mask that feels great, so would guess this would feel good too, just not as intense."
'5'.'0',It's a good mask but it is heavy since weighted. I really like the small beads and the coldness.  I sorta wish it wasn't weighted but it is so dark,"Since they spray us so heavily,  my eyes are always burning.  This mask relieves the pain and helps me fall asleep in no time at all.  Its inexpensive and so helpful."
'5'.'0',"I have always struggled with falling asleep, but this mask knocks me out and keeps me out. It's too good at keeping me asleep because it's nearly impossible to wake up in the morning when I sleep with it on. My only concern is how the weight might affect my eyes long term or cause more wrinkles, but I'm not sure about that.",This feels very comfortable. I have only used as a cool compress for eye relief. You must use it immediately out of the freezer. Even 20 minutes will allow it to warm up and not really be used for intended cold therapy. When used immediately it feels great. The material and weight feel like this would also work well for warm therapy. I bought a gel eye mask after this that will stay colder much longer after pulling from the freezer. This is a better quality mask but loses the cool quickly.
'5'.'0',"This is wonderful! It feels like sand inside, not glass beads. It has helped me even sleep, and I wake to less and less headaches. One of the best things I've purchased on Amazon. Very soothing !",Helps keep my room dark for sleep.
'5'.'0',,I sleep like a rock with this mask
'4'.'0',Good find but not total darkness,Soothing and comforting
'4'.'0',"This eye mask is weighted, and feels good on my face. No pressure on my eyes. And its just heavy enough to make it therapeutic.  It is exactly as the photos. And its adjustable to fit your head. My only complaint would be that the spot were the white ""V""s are, the light comes through if you have the lights on. Most people will have the lights off. This bothered me as I was looking for something that 100% blocks light, as my husband will be awake hours past me with the bedroom lights or TV on. If that doesnt bother you, then its well worth getting and would get 5 stars.","I have allergies, sinus issues and migraines. Between chilling this of warming it, I get relief and better sleep!!"
'4'.'0',"It's full of just plastic beads, so it doesn't stay cold for long. But I really like it. It is easy to adjust and comfortable to wear whether cold or not. It blocks light really well.",Cuts out light when get migraine
'4'.'0',"Put ear plugs in and wear this mask, you litterally forget you exist. Best eye mask ive had. And it stays cold till well after you fall asleep.",Surprisingly relaxing
'4'.'0',Nice mask but doesn't stay cooo,As the title says. But most likely very comfortable for people without lash extensions.
'4'.'0',I was looking for an eye mask to help my dry eyes. I love the pressure but this one doesnt get cold enough to do any real help,"It keeps out light So I can sleep peacefully, Also  it has space between mask and eyes so does rest on your eyes when sleeping I think this is hygiene wise."
'4'.'0',"5 star cooling mask, not so great as sleeping mask","I like it in winter, summer time I cant use it, I need something lighter"
'4'.'0',"Very comfortable, yet slightly bulky eyemask",Most comfortable sleep mask I've ever had.
'4'.'0',Took some fiddling to get it comfortable!,"I have trouble sleeping unless Im in total darkness, so Ive tried a lot of sleep masks over the years. This one is very comfortable and blocks the light well. There is plenty of room for eye movement without the mask touching my eyelashes. The extra weight of the filling was slightly unusual at first but then i think it helped me to relax more. The material is very smooth and doesnt irritate my skin like some of my previous masks."
'4'.'0',Umisleep Weighted Eye Mask,"A lot less heat build up than other masks, good fit, I like the weight. Need to be replaced after a few months, the seams holding the beads give up after a while."
'4'.'0',,"This totally blocks out all light and its really comfortable on and around the eyes. The best feature, I would say, is that you can open your eyes without taking the mask off. This allows you to be woken by accident and then fall back asleep quickly and easily with little interruption to your sleep.Only issue is the strap is very poorly designed with a buckle that allows the strap to become contorted very easily. This can be uncomfortable on the sides of the head, as the strap becomes bunched and irritating.Im still happy with the purchase, but id have preferred one with a better strap."
'4'.'0',"I have migraines, so I got this hoping for some relief. It does not cure, but it does ease the migraine up some. It isnt so cold that it freezes your face like some masks. It isnt gel so you dont have to mush it around trying to get it just right, gravity and your face contour do it for you. The glass beads are really small in it, so no worry about large beads in it.","It is a very nice mask, nicely weighted, and has an adjustable strap on the back for people with big or small heads (like me). Its also very comfortable. Unfortunately, the mask didnt fit me perfectly and I could see light coming out of the bottom of the mask, even after I adjusted the straps. I have a long nose so that could be why it didnt fit me perfectly, but if you are looking for total darkness and eye coverage then it might not work for you."
'4'.'0',Softer & more comfortable than last one,"This eye mask has a good weight to it with depressions so theyre not as heavy on the eyeballs. The filling rounds the mask, which may be why this seems to let a bit more light in around my nose than typical masks. The strap is wider and seems better made than others I often see. Overall, it lived up to expectations and is well priced right now ($14.99 minus 30%). It came in a sealed bag in another zip bag (neither is meant to be a reusable storage bag)."
'4'.'0',"The mask is weighted nicely. However, I purchased it to be put in the freezer and then applied it to the eyes for relief. Unfortunately, the mask doesnt stay cold long enough. If the glass beads were larger, this might have a different effect.",Doesn't stay cold for long
'4'.'0',I feel like this really helps with my migraines.  It is also great for a sleeping mask without migraines. I wear it every night and feel it prevents some migraines as well as relieves them.The only thing I dont like is that there isnt space for my eyelashes when I blink.  My eyelashes are smashed/flatten down and hard to curl in the morning.,"My roommate loves it, I cant get used to it. So, maybe its not for everyone"
'3'.'0',Nice weight and light lavender scentDoes not stay cool more than 15 minutes when you really need something cold for a migraineHad it in fridge for 45 minutes before use,The sand shifts and becomes uneven
'3'.'0',loved the ice cold feeling of this on my face but after 3rd day of use the small amount of freezer time it had made it stink terribly! I cannot get the scent out and my freezer doesnt smell!,This is a great weighted sleep mask. I kept it in the freezer for migraines and it was nice and cool the first 2 minutes. It did not cold it's coldness for relief.
'3'.'0',"Thought this was way too heavy to wear all night. Made my face very hot, could not tolerate. Really wanted to like this as I have been looking for a nice comfortable mask, but this did not fit the bill for me, maybe others will like it tough. Nice thick material that I think would hold up well.","Works well, very glad the head strap is NOT Velcro!!"
'3'.'0',Bulky With Uneven Distribution,"The Umisleep Weighted Cooling Sleep Mask was wonderful as a cooling therapy mask, but it didn't work as a sleeping mask for me.There's much to like about the Umisleep weighted cooling sleep mask. The fabric was nice and soft, it felt really good around the sensitive eye area. I put it in the freezer until it was chilled throughout and it was tremendously relaxing and therapeutic for my tired eyes. The 'V?? design in the middle kept the mask from touching my eyelids but the outer edges of my eyes were covered in soothing coolness. I know some would really like that feature as they're uncomfortable with the blurry vision that sometimes comes after using heat or cold on their eyes. I didn't experience any vision distortion with this mask. That chilled area is weighted, which feels really good and also caused the mask to hug my face nicely. (The cold lasts a generous amount of time.) The back strap is adjustable, so I was able to create the perfect fit. I was so relaxed from the experience that I fell asleep in my recliner.After I finished my first session with the mask I put it back in the freezer to rechill for later use. I grabbed it on my way to bed that night to see how I'd like it as a sleep mask. I immediately could see that this wouldn't be a 'total blackout?? mask, light filtered in around the edges. I laid back on my pillow, closed my eyes and began to drift away. At some point I turned on my side, which is when I realized this wouldn't be a good sleep mask choice for me. The weighted part of the mask that surrounded my eyes and had felt so glorious moments before was now presenting as a hard, uncomfortable lump between my face and my pillow. I shifted position a bit, but nope??. this wasn't something that could be made better. I took off the mask and went back to my old sleep mask.My final evaluation is that this makes a marvelous cold therapy mask. It's a good design and well made. It's very comfortable. It could also possibly be a good sleep mask if one only slept on their back. It felt great as I slept in the recliner, but when I'm in bed I change positions making it a poor choice for regular sleep use. It's an excellent mask, depending on how one uses it. It is also washable, a feature that's very much appreciated.****About me: Integrity is very important to me. Reviews Ive posted will be from items Ive had direct contact with. These are my honest opinions. I will not post a review for a product I have not had personal contact with."
'3'.'0',Difficult to sleep in,"I really love the design of this eye mask. It is silky soft to the touch, puts pressure in all the right places (none on your actual eyes, but relieves the sinus area), and blocks out any light perfectly especially since it has an adjustable strap.My one and only complaint is that it is a bit bulky to wear and so, for a side sleeper like me, I have found that it either slides off in the middle of the night or makes me sleep at an angle I wouldnt normally choose. For that, it loses one star."
'4'.'0',I like the look and feel.  The adjustable strap is great.  I still get little bits of light around nose if I move/rollover.  Better than others I have tried but not my unicorn perfect mask.,"Strap is very adjustable! BUT I had loosen it quite a bit to get a comfortable loose fit and I have a small head. Then it was too lose when i got out of bed!Material is very soft! Even the beads feel good against the face. BUT the beads are all over the place. You have to squish and shake from side to side to try and even them out. Eventually, the beads to the bottom seemed to work the best. Love the weight of the mask after i play with where the beads should be?Most importantly, there was still pressure on my eyes UNTIL I got the beads just right.And lastly there wasnt 100 percent black out without some pressure on my nose bridge. All of these things could be my weird face, and most were resolved with some fiddling. But it shouldnt be that hard to make it comfortable. All in all tho it does all that it claims once you take the time to adjust things EACH time you put it on.."
'4'.'0',"I use an eye mask every night.  These are very comfortable.  I like that they are slightly concave over the eye area so there is no pressure on the eyes at all.  Completely blocks the light and is very comfortable to use, and not hot to sleep with.  2 thumbs up.","This looks exactly as it does in the promo photos. No instructions were included. The material is stretchy, but soft, and there is a bit of weight to it. I was hoping for a bit more weight to it, honestly.  The two Vs in the mask are supposed to keep the mask off your eyes and lashes, and it does it, but they also let a bit of light in, so not exactly blackout if one opens their eyes. The strap is nice an stretchy, easy to make fit on the face and head.  The description states these have a cooling effect since its filled with micro glass beads. There is no cooling effect that I can detect right out of the package. theyll need to be placed in the fridge/freezer,"
'4'.'0',"It is very comfortable to wear on your head.  But the eye wells are not deep enough, and it rides up on when you sleep.  So the edges rub against your eyes.",I was going to return this face mask after purchasing different eye massagers but this is a well-constructed face mask and you can fall asleep with it on and not be concerned with sleep interruption. Also the materiel inside can be removed for easy launder. ?'? This eye mask stayed cool for almost 15 minutes! It was much better than the EyeSpa Pods by RENPHO!Definitely recommend! Hope this helps?'?
'4'.'0',Not really a tiny bra,Heavier than I thought but that's my fault. Also the band disconnects at times when taking off. Also smelled like pepper when I received it?
'4'.'0',These have worked pretty good for my needs.  Definitely helps block out light.  They are very soft and comfortable. The only issue I have is when I wear my CPAP they rid up a little bit because they're kind of big.  That's why I went with a 4 star??,"It's great & soothes headaches as it should, just wish the cold would last longer. I have to flip it."
'4'.'0',"satisfied with purchase,  efective, comforta ble",I wish the loop was closed at the top because the band slides through. I want to order a 2nd one but I need to find a way to keep it in place.
'4'.'0',I really like this mask.  My only complaint is the elastic gives out so quickly.,Very comfortable and stays in place. Pellets need to be adjusted frequently
'2'.'0',Doesnt stay cold for long,"Contrary to what their ad says, it is not total blocking the light, It DOES let light through the bottom.I really dont understand why these masks have a little flap at the bottom that does not block all light. Why dont they have a thick piece or foam or something that fully seals against the face unlike the silly little flap."
'2'.'0',"very comfortable and soft, but not cold!","I was curious how a weighted sleeping mask would feel like, but my didnt like it as much as I had expected. The weight gets kind of annoying, the nose pad isnt as effective as the ones from the sleep masks I used before this one, and I loose the mask every night, it doesnt stay in place (maybe because the material is a bit slippery, but, on the plus side, it feels nice), when I wake up at night, I notice the mask got out of place and lets light in."
'2'.'0',it is soft and does not freeze your face off when you put it on. the strap is adjustable. but it only stays cold for about 15,Feels good but smells
'2'.'0',Its too heavy cant sleep,Really wanted to Like this But !
'2'.'0',Works great for maybe 10 minutes.  Not long enough to be effective,"Works good feels nice on but and it's a big one, the clasp on the band gets caught in my hair every time and it's painful getting it off/out of my hair"
'2'.'0',,"I liked the concept of this eye mask but the design isnt quite there. The beading inside shifts with movement and causes them to pile to one side if you turn over or if it was stored at a weird angle. You have to manually shift the beaded so it lays ""flat"" in the mask and against your face. I also found the upper placement uncomfortable because it pressed on the area between my brow bone and eyelid. The one nice thing is the adjustable strap! If you air travel or always sleep on your back, this may work for you. The weight/beading was more uncomfortable than soothing to me."
'2'.'0',It was nice to sleep in but it was a haste getting it from the fridge every night and it started to give me acne and usually have clear skin.,"The madk is very heavy and you can feel it on your face pretty much all the time. It is hard to focus on falling asleep.The string does not split and goes accross your ears. The other masks I used in the past have string split do one part goes under your ears and second part goes over your ears, without touching them. It is not a problem initially but ears do hurt during the night and the pain wakes you up. Because the string doesnt split you have to keep it over your ears (which causes mask to slip off the head upwards) or under the ears (which causes mask to slip off the head downwards). In every case it is hard to keep the mask on the face throughout the whole night. If you tighten string up it makes ears to hurt.I honestly dont like the product.The only positive I can say about it is that the holes in the mask are perfect size and you can quite comfortably open your eyes in it."
'2'.'0',"Vs other weighted eye masks, this one is hard to adjust and cannot be washed, so I just need to throw it away, which feels wasteful.","Even though the front part is very nice, I am only giving 2 stars because the back strap is very thin and uncomfortable"
'2'.'0',The weighted part is amazing but as soon as u put it on the cold stays for like a min or two. I was looking for something that actually would help with headaches which means it needed to stay cold for a little bit at least. If ur looking for a good eye mask tho the weighted part definitely was a plus,Its quite heavy so can cause headache.
'2'.'0',"I was really excited to try this out and really never leave bad reviews. I was super super disappointed by this face mask. I suffer from migraines and thought this may help, as I have others that do relieve the pain by cooling the face.This mask literally lasted LESS than 5 minutes of cold. There was no purpose of buying it or using it.The only reason why I gave it 2 stars was because I thought the weight was nice on my face, but I didnt need an eye cover, I needed a cold face mask..I have no way to contact the company directly or else I would have and I am super upset by this product.",Its really just an eye mask. Not a weighted on.
'2'.'0',"This is soft and comfortable, but I bought it to use cold for migraines and it warms up SO fast. Straight from the freezer, it lasts maybe 5",Comfortable eye masks
'2'.'0',"Also, I think it is too heavy. But this depends on each persons taste. Not what I expected.",Great for long lashes
'2'.'0',Elastic band fits oddly and slides around my head.,THE EYE WELLS ARE NOT DEEP ENOUGH
'2'.'0',"These are just OK.  They do stand off from the eyes, which is very nice.  They don't seal out all light as they don't have the wire at the nose, or the little flap, so they gap.  After one time through the washing machine, one of the pairs has started to separate on the inside.  The fabric is pulling away from the foam.  I would not recommend for regular use, and I wouldn't buy them again, but for a flight or vacation they'd be fine.","I use a sleeping mask every night because it helps work my anxiety and these are great. They dont put a bunch of pressure on my eyes and are very comfortable. I will say they break down if you wash them often, but the comfort is so worth it!"
'2'.'0',"I am just mystified that these are for side sleeping. When you sleep on your side and put your head sideways on your pillow the mask pushes upward, I have had to take it off and wear the regular masks. The only way that these work is if you lay on your back or just have your face looking upwards. I will not buy these again.","They may look like tiny brasieres, but they arent. Theyre eye masks!Lifts, supports, and separates your eyes. Keeps them covered. Comfortable strap in back. Provides for modesty in public situations."
'2'.'0',"While the mask is soft, it's actually very rigid. To keep snug enough to block the light, it must be very tight. But then the wide strap hurts my ears. Also, if it slides down at all, it hurts my nose. Not a good mask, at least for me. I was very disappointed.","good purchase, effective"
'2'.'0',Mask is only mildly successful for side sleepers. Mask still presses you temple area if you're a side sleeper. Be fine for a back sleeper,Truly as advertisedNow I can sleep
'2'.'0',Extremely Uncomfortable,"i liked the weight and the softness, but it hardly stays cold once removed from the freezer"
'2'.'0',"I purchased these masks for a second time because I really enjoyed my last ones but they've all ripped open. I assume I just use them a lot but it could also be poor quality. I love the way they fit along the bridge of my nose, which is very sensitive for me. But what I received this time was quite a bit smaller than the ones I had received previously. They're rather tight on my face and the eye countour doesn't fit well. I'm really disappointed with these. I will continue to use them because I haven't found anything else that's comfortable on my nose.","It does not stay cold. Starts to warm up in less than 5 minutes. For me, that is not long enough to help with headaches. It is comfy on the eyes, however. The material is soft and not too heavy."
'5'.'0',"Block out all light, sleep great.  No more ambien for me. I will buy again","I really wanted and needed this to work after a surgery.  Unfortunately while is is very comfortable and soft, for some reason, the filling does not get cold at all.  I even tried keeping it in the freezer for a few hours first, but no cold relief.  I put it on and it just felt like a comfortable weighted mask, with no benefits of the cold relief.  Disappointed."
'5'.'0',Love these! I have never had such an good black out sleeping mask. I'm glad I lost my old one and got this!,only cold for 10-15min
'5'.'0',Purchase for trip to Iceland this summer and these were absolutely wonderful.Comfortable to wear throughout the night as the sun never said in sometimes the hotel black out curtains we're not all that effective.,"Hardly stays cold for 15 minutes, after being in freezer for hours. I suffer from chronic migraines and found no relief with this."
'5'.'0',So great and the raised eye works great helps so much with my sleep,Stays cold for very short period of time
'5'.'0',"I love this material, blocks out light completely, not too hot like any others I have purchased, just a little warm to be expected. SO EASY TO CLEAN. EVERY other face mask I have ordered gets covered in pet hair that won't come off even with a hardcore pet hair/lint roller. This mask doesn't even need to be wiped off cuz it just doesn't even let hair stick to it at all. Super soft material, and blocks light from my bedroom that's an ALL WINDOW SUN ROOM. The band is soft and adjustable and doesn't even feel like it's there. Even when wearing it loose to allow a little air from my fan in my face, almost no light comes in through the nose part where I allow air flow. Non tangle strap for hair, although I don't have long or even much hair, (like about 7 inches Feaux","I really wanted to like this sleep mask, but it was very uncomfortable. Theres not much of a curve near the bottom where your nose should be, so the weight made it crush my nose which in turn made it impossible to breathe out of it. The stitching near the eyes is extremely small, so you have this weird combo of weight pressing at the corners of your eyes with nothing pressing at the center, which managed to give me a mild headache rather than any relief.Maybe my face is just shaped weird, but this didnt work for me at all."
'5'.'0',"I really like the masks, they are very soft and totally block the light!",Cant wash and hard to adjust
'4'.'0',PROS: I really liked the adjustable band. Soft and pretty fabric. The eye cups help keep mask from pressing on your eyes. Big plus!CONS: I have a small face and the eye cups are a bit too large for me. Mask can make my eyes too warm sometimes. Overall a better than average eye mask.,It doesn't stay cold at all
'4'.'0',These are great on all types of faces and there is good nose room. I only took off one star for more eyelash room.,"It blocks out light fairly well, but the overall fit isn't comfortable. It causes pain to on the ears as well."
'4'.'0',Bought before and these seem slightly different,DOESNT STAY COLD LONG
'4'.'0',The mask fit very comfortably but they smell like burnt plastic was not able to wear after 1st recommended wash so I am soaking them in laundry detergent to hopefully remove the smell.,No good for cold therapy
'4'.'0',I like this product except for the closure style. It would be better to use velcro instead of a sliding adjustment  because the metal oval that it slides thru to adjust always goes off center and is painful to lay on. Mostly tho  I find the elastic over my ears is very uncomfortable and finally found an ez fix. I tacked (sewed)a sock to the elastic over each ear. Just folded the sock in half with it hanging over the elastic on each side evenly. Now i have the comfort on my ear and the elastic can move as needed. Better than trying to invent something. Also get a benefit of muffled noises. Eureka!!,"Made decent but,, The beads get hot way too quick... Was hoping for a colder gel effect that last a but longer. I got 2 pair. As my son & I both get badddd headaches. Returned both."
'4'.'0',"These are comfortable and good at blocking light. Ive used them for years. But after a certain amount of time, the seams start coming apart, which is annoying.",Fabric releasing from foam after one wash
'4'.'0',The masks are a nice color. They did not have any odors. They are able to adjust the size.,Cannot sleep on your side
'3'.'0',They work fine but strap is uncomfortable,"The package of 3 masks that I received were about 1/2"" smaller than the masks pictured in the images, so that the bottom of the mask only came to the bottom of my eye, not to my cheek.  I have measured them against previous purchases of similar items and they are definitely smaller.  Too uncomfortable to wear as they press against my eye."
'3'.'0',Not really a good size for adults,"Nah, still not for side sleeper"
'3'.'0',I think these sleeping masks are good to protect your lash extensions during the night but I toss and turn throughout the night. So by morning it's usually beside me or around my neck.,You get what you pay for
'3'.'0',"These are not completely black out, you can notice light through the material, as well as gaps on the nose.","Lots of light coming from the nose area.Ive tried adjusting the tightness and fit a few ways, but no difference.The mask itself is soft and the padding does not touch your eyelids which is nice"
'3'.'0',Although these masks are very comfortable they stunk upon opening. I had to wash them for the smell to come out .,"While at first glance these seem like they would be extremely comfortable and soft, they are not. They are stiff and feel hard against your face even when adjusted to fit loosely and you will be conscious of them the entire time you are wearing them, which is not conducive to good sleep by any stretch of the imagination. Not worth the gas to return them so theyll be donated. If you want a comfortable sleep mask buy a silk one in a dark color, the original simple design is still the best and most effective. Sometimes you cant build a better mousetrap."
'3'.'0',"Some design flaws, but overall works well enough",Got these for my dad and he loves them. He gets much better sleep now
'3'.'0',"Overall, they were ok, but I really disliked how non",Great fit & comfortable
'5'.'0',I use these every night. Bought a new house and we have small windows over our bed we have yet to get blinds for. These masks are super soft and do the trick. Can barely tell youre wearing it as it give plenty of room for eyelashes and doesnt touch your lids.,"They fit well, comfortable to wear, keeps the light out,  I really like them."
'5'.'0',"Perfect for a mom needing sleep or a dad who works night and sleeps during the day.Super snug and 100% blackout no matter the time it day, since I had these I can't imagine sleeping without them.","No pressure on eyes, Easy clean, pet hair wipes right off, soft blocks all light."
'5'.'0',I travel alot for business and being on a long day time flight with other passengers insisting on the window open didnt allow me to take a much needed nap.  So I went looking for something comfortable.  These are incredible and the price is great!  You can blink your eyes while wearing them and even keep your eyes open...no one can tell.  LOL  Great way to hush up a talkative seat mate.  LOL,These are great They keep all light out and dont feel pressure on you eyes
'5'.'0',These fit comfortable and you cant beat the price,These sleep masks help me to sleep
'5'.'0',They do the job and are comfortable,Great but one small improvement...
'5'.'0',,"But its made that way to keep it's shape. Overall, it gets the job done - blackout."
'5'.'0',Everything about this item is wonderful,like a cotton hug for your face
'5'.'0',"I've been literally been through a dozen sleep masks in search of the right balance of light blocking, comfortability on the eyes and nose, and a strap that doesn't annoy my ears or leave a mark. (For the record, I have a shaved head, so I'm likely more sensitive to the strap issues I've encountered)While I do wish this mask was a touch thicker and that I didn't feel any pressure on my eyes whatsoever, the fact is I've finally found the best overall balance of all necessities.Light blocking",Comfortable to wear and blocks out all light
'5'.'0',Comfortable to wear and blocks all light. Doesnt get caught on hair. No chemical smell.,Works well with piercings
'5'.'0',"I have bought almost a dozen sleep masks, trying to find one that blocks light while also being comfortable with multiple cartilage piercings. Most masks get caught or press on the ears, either due to the design or due to shifting during sleep. This mask does neither. It fits over a larger surface area than other masks (covering my entire ears, forehead, and temples), but is a soft jersey fabric that doesnt yank or irritate.It does soak up moisture quite easily, so I will be buying several pieces in order to start a washing rotation. People who sweat heavily or have an oily complexion may want to do the same.","Soft quality item, with cooling- like effects. The fit is perfect if the strap other masks are designed with makes you uncomfortable."
'5'.'0',This is the best sleep mask I've ever had. Very comfortable & blocks out all the light.,This is the most comfortable sleep mask that Ive ever used.
'5'.'0',This is a game changer for me!  Since Ive been using the mask Ive had the most fulfilling sleep Ive had in a while.  Im actually mad that I didnt invest in this particular mask sooner.  Great product!,Blocks out enough light (I sleep in a VERY bright room)
'5'.'0',"I sleep in a room with a ton of windows and its very bright. Unlike others, this sleep mask actually stays on y our head when you roll over on your side when asleep. It blocks out enough light to make it seem like you are in the dark. It fits comfortably over your nose and the strap in the back for a snug fit.My only con with this mask is after washing it, I had to readjust the head strap but you cant even call it a con since there is velcro","Full coverage, comfortable sleep mask"
'5'.'0',This mask is so comfortable. It can be rolled up so it's compact for traveling. It's lightweight enough for comfort but not too much that it falls off your face. Great price too! It feels like good quality and should last some years of frequent use.,So comfy and lifetime product
'5'.'0',"This is the best eye mask ever. I purchased one a few years ago and bought another two for my parents. They love it, too.",?
'5'.'0',This product is so soft and comfy. it changed my sleep life. I would recommend it 100%,Love it! Soft and comfortable
'5'.'0',I live it. I've tried several masks and this one is by far my favorite! Definitely recommend.,Supremely comfortable and totally light blocking.
'5'.'0',"This mask is so perfect that after purchasing one for my husband I ordered another for myself. Never has a sleep mask been so comfortable and stayed in place all night. Im thrilled. Any light really effects my sleep. This mask solves that problem perfectly, as well as, being rather comforting to wear. Highly recommend this product.",So soft and doesnt make a mess of my hair!
'5'.'0',"This has turned out to be my favorite sleep mask and I think I have tried them on. It is very soft, stays on my face the whole night which is amazing. I am a restless side sleeper and this mask really works for me.",Soft and confortable!
'5'.'0',The best sleep mask ever!,I love the way the mask fits and how soft it is. No pressure on my eyes and provides true restfulness
'5'.'0',I loved my mask so much that I ordered another one. It's unbelievably soft and feels wonderful. Using it helps me have very comfortable sleep.Covering both eyes and ears is really great!,"Yes it blocks light and muffled sound, but the biggest part that puts me to sleep is the feeling that its a big hug on my face. It swaddles my head like Im in the womb or something, and I think that has made the biggest improvement to my sleep."
'5'.'0',These are addictive they are so soft...,Ive used these masks for years and my family likes them as well.  I just purchased two more for friends I had gifted the masks to several years ago because they want to take them as a gift to relatives back East.  These really are helpful in getting a good nights sleep.
'5'.'0',Can a sleep mask be luxury? Yes it can.,Love this mask. Stays on and is so soft.
'5'.'0',Adjusts to fit perfectly,"Covers your eyes softly and allows your eyes to stay closed.  Bought another that was sort of cupped and any noise, I opened my eyes in the mask....hard time going back to sleep.  This mask also softly covers your ears as opposed to a band or tie; with a velcro adjustable closure.  Love it."
'5'.'0',Very comfortable to wear.,"I purchased a couple of similar products, comfort is very important to me and this product was easily the most comfortable.The material is soft, pliable and silky, there are no metal bands or clips. The velcro in the back gives a great amount of flexibility to match your head size.  Would buy again."
'5'.'0',"Ive used a few of these and this is the best one so far. Comfortable and blocks light. Good velcro clasp. I was concerned because I have a big nose, and it doesnt have a big nose cutout, but it works well.",Extremely comfortable
'5'.'0',Love this eye shield! So cozy but will flatten any hairdo.,"I have bought two of these. I am very, very, picky. And as far as I am concerned, these are the best sleep masks ever made!!! Completely blocks the light. It Is so soft. As a side sleeper, it is important to be comfortable and still let no light in.I will buy again and agin."
'5'.'0',Found this on a travel YouTube video. It works great. Its much better than the regular eye masks on the market. This one doesnt let light in. Higher recommend.,Most comfortable Ive ever tried
'5'.'0',"I opened up the package to a beautifully soft, comfortable eye mask. At first, I thought it was going to be too big, I have a small head (I wear childrens size ball caps.) However, it fit snuggly, and comfortably. I also thought it may be too bulky on the back and sides, but after my first nights sleep, I can say it wasnt. No light came though, and it dodnt slip at all. Usually other sleep masks slip throughout the night and Im always adjusting it, but not this one! Im pleased with this mask so far. We shall see how it holds up!",This is so soft I don't feel it on. I love how I can sleep on my side and it doesn't even feel like it's there. It totally blocks out the light! I'm getting one for my husband too.
'5'.'0',"This was my alternative instead of getting the black out curtains and everything to black out my room. I decided to go with this head wrap and it's really comfortable sits well over the bridge of my nose also has ear plugs pieces that I wear and it cancels out everything my eyes are well rested. It's machine washable, and I see no light when I wear it even if it's in a bright room.",So soft and comfortable and blocks out the light!
'5'.'0',The size is perfect. It will fit from small to really large if you have thick hair. The material is extremely soft and I can't wait to use it on the plane!! I highly recommend this item!!?'?,"Sometimes I'll take a little nap in the afternoons to recharge my batteries. When I slip this mask on, it's cool and totally dark. There's no light reaching my pupils and within about 60 seconds, I'm sound asleep. Once my batts return to normal, I'm up and ready to rumble!!! (Brilliant idea.  Wish I'd thought of this)"
'5'.'0',Very Very Very Comfortable,I have used regular eye shades with an elastic band but find them uncomfortable. These are very comfortable with no pressure spots. They also keep your ears warm if you are sleeping in a cold room. Pair them with some good ear plugs and get ready for plenty of ZZZZs
'5'.'0',"Great, now I am able to take naps during the day, and while traveling.Totally recommend it!",This sleep mask is so comfy and so efficient. The first night I used it I slept so soundly. Do be careful if you move in your sleep because it can slide off but for the most part the velcro helps it stay in place. Im not one for writing reviews often but this product is worth it.
'5'.'0',"Big fan of this mask as it doesnt bother my ears and feels super soft...would buy again and just might because my wife keeps stealing it, lol",Soft and comfortable!
'5'.'0',This is very soft but secure over the head and doesn't have discomfort on the side on the pillow when I sleep.  Well done,Soft and works wonderfully to keep the light out at night
'5'.'0',Fantastic.  So comfortable,"Honestly it's a bit overpriced for what it is, however, it's so comfy and soft, and let's no light in."
'5'.'0',"I love this night mask! It is super soft on the face, does not get hot when wearing at night. Is adjustable and machine washable.","I struggle to sleep during longer dayand this mask is perfect. It's a comfortable, adjustable mask that provides great light blockage, does not make me hot, and I am grateful!  The fabric is soft and oh so nice on my skin.  Looking forward to finally getting some sleep,"
'5'.'0',"Soft, no light, comfy for side sleeping",One of the best products I have ever purchased on Amazon
'5'.'0',"Comfortable, great fabric, blocks light",Great coverage for the eyes and ears.
'5'.'0',I work nights and sleep during the day. This mask is so soft and comfortable that I forget that Im wearing it,I am about to by a third eye mask for my daughter. I have been using mine for 4 years and love it. It blocks all the light out of from bright room and I throw it in the wash often to keep it clean. Highly recommend.
'5'.'0',"This is a great item, very soft, and full light blocking coverage for the eyes. So happy I found this item, I just ordered one for my husband.",This is absolutely the BEST sleep mask Ive ever had. I was a night shift worker for more than 10 years and all the sleep masks had uncomfortable straps up over the ears and light always leaked in around my nose. This mask is soft and padded with contouring around the nose. No painful straps. The material softly wraps around your head and velcros in the back. Total darkness. Incredible!
'5'.'0',"Nice product, I have tried several types of sleepmasks and this one is the most confortable I tried, very soft.",very comfortable highly recommend
'5'.'0',No straps. Covers ears to dampen snoring noise.,Its soft and covers both your eyes and ears. The ear plugs are an added bonus. Excellent if your spouse snores.
'5'.'0',very soft and comfortable,Comfortable and very soft
'5'.'0',Sleep mask for quiet sleep,"I ended up buying two, because if I lose one I wont be able to sleep. So soft and comfortable. It adds a gentle pressure to my eyes that helps me relax and fall asleep. And in the morning it keeps out any light so I dont wake up too early. Definitely recommend for people who are light sleepers."
'5'.'0',"Have tried many eye masks and this is best combination of light blocking, softness, and without the elastic wearing out and becoming too loose.",Glad to find a comfortable mask made of cotton
'5'.'0',Now I cant sleep without it...,Very comfortable!  Super-soft.
'5'.'0',This 100% cotton mask works perfectly to help me get to sleep at night.  The mask fabric is soft and the velcro strap works better than an elastic one to keep the mask in place without being irritated.,I hate the pressure from the strap on typical wraps so this was perfect for me! Added bonus of sound muffling and good coverage for minimal light intrusion. Super soft fabric
'5'.'0',I look forward to using this sleep mask in the near future.,Full width upper head wrap makes it more secure than any other
'5'.'0',I've tried multiple sleeping masks over the years.  The blackout of the light that this mask provides is absolutely amazing! The material is really soft.  I am a side sleeper so the sleekness of this mask on the sides (and all around) really helps.,It behaves as it should
'5'.'0',"This face mask is a little steep on price but is very worth it. Its soft, comfortable, and darkens all light out. I even wear headphones underneath and its still so comfortable. I hand wash and air dry it as others have said the dryer heat ruins the velcro and it has worked out well so far. Additionally, other reviews have talked about stretching and it might have a little but theres enough that it is still tight to my head. Once again, I highly recommend it.","I work nights and my room gets very bright during the day, this has been a life saver. Super soft too!"
'5'.'0',"I bought this and the manta pro (the most expensive on the market). And without caring about prices, I returned the manta pro because this mask stays in place when you move your head on your pillow. This isnt perfect. There may be a light gap at the nose. It lets light through if you test it outside in daytime.But its so wide and soft that it stays secure even when tossing & turning, allows for adjustment to pull down to cover nose gaps (get the slightly more expensive version for semi","This mask is pretty comfortable and I feel like it doesn't weigh on my eyes too badly, mostly because it is adjustable and I can make it as tight or lose as I I want. It also doesn't get hot or uncomfortable when wearing."
'5'.'0',Perfect for night shifters!,Can't sleep without it!
'5'.'0',I really like this sleeping mask. It is comfortable and works well for me.,Works and is very comfortable
'5'.'0',"I use this mask every night, and I love it! It's super comfortable, light and pillowy. It doesn't hurt my head or give me a headache like other sleep masks, and I love how adjustable it is and how much light it blocks out. Highly recommend!",This is the first mask that is actually cotton so I dont wake up sweating and actually blocks out all of the light.  I like that its big enough and has extra fabric to fit around the bridge of your nose so that it is actually blocking out all of the light.  I discovered it from my son and now my sister is ordering one.  We love it!!
'5'.'0',This is my favorite eye mask.,LOVE the design and comfort
'5'.'0',Put it on and dont feel any discomfort at all!! Stays cool at room temp and feels soft and cool to the touch. 10/10 great product!,"This sleep mask blocks out all light. It covers from the top of the forehead to just above the nostrils. It has two small wedges on each side of the nose to block out light. It is very soft, fairly breathable, and has some stretch to it."
'5'.'0',This is absolutely the best sleep mask I have ever used. No annoying strap on the back of the head. Its extremely soft. Breathes very well. Keeps cool. Fantastic ?'?,Very comfortable but loves to shift
'5'.'0',"This is perfect for me. Covers ears and eyes, very comfortable (another company has a silky one and I like the one much better as it stays in place), soft, blackout. Im thrilled.",Very soft and comfortable
'5'.'0',I absolutely LOVE this! I work 3rd shift (11pm,Most comfortable eye mask I own
'5'.'0',Great at blocking the light and staying put,I wear it every night.
'5'.'0',"And I've bought a lot. I use every night, my wife watches TV late with headphones.",Fits comfortably and adjusts well
'5'.'0',I recently moved into an apartment with an east,Definitely softer/less noticeable than most sleeping masks
'5'.'0',Very soft. Fits securely. Cool and comfortable. Very glad I bought this.,"I got these for my girlfriend and I to replace the basic ones with the tiny strap on the back and wow they are so much more comfortable! I used to wake up to the little strap digging behind my ears, but this eye mask is comfy all around!"
'5'.'0',"Blocks out light, easy to forget its there.","I love this mask and have multiple of them.  This is the first sleep mask Ive seen that isnt bulky but totally covered your eyes AND ears.  The fabric is unbelievably soft and any adjustments in size are easy with the Velcro closure.My only issue is that since Im very light sensitive, its easy to oversleep!"
'5'.'0',These are very soft and block light better than probably any other sleep mask (other than a blindfold) that Ive used. If youre shopping around for sleeping masks try this one first.,"I tried on many sleep masks before deciding to keep this one. Other masks that I tried pressed against my eyes, my nose, my ears, the back of my head when I lay on my pillow and it was very uncomfortable, and I couldn't fall sleep this way. This mask is super soft and super comfortable and blocks out the light as it should. The one downside is that on occasion, when it is very humid, the mask gets damp from sweat, and it is very slow to dry."
'5'.'0',I cant pause this enough.  Light and noise blocking,"I have had a blackout mask for several years and loved it, except for the notch that is used to expand or shrink the headband. The Velcro on this sleep mask took some getting used to because I dont have a large head, so there is a bit of the strip that isnt held down by Velcro. Nevertheless, the mask blocks all light, which results in me being complete knocked out after my head hits the pillow."
'5'.'0',"Super soft, super comfortable, sleep mask",Was a gift for a friend??loved it. So comfortable & was given awesome reviews. Would definitely recommend.
'5'.'0',Light Canceling Sleep Mask,"This mask is great and super comfortable, and most importantly you can wear it while sleeping on your side or stomach with very little inconvenience. It's light and soft and doesn't put too much pressure on your face or eyes. In addition, this version is 'upgraded?? with more material around the nose area. Seems like a small thing, but it makes a huge difference in blocking out light effectively."
'5'.'0',Cozy cotton sleep mask,"Apparently I have a big head because some sleep masks are too small but it fits, & it doesnt have an annoying metal thing where the strap joins the mask which would touch my temple which Id hate--its the only sleep mask Ive found that doesnt."
'5'.'0',Great Manta alternative for side/stomach sleepers,"Soft, fluffy, blocks out all light??just replaced my old one w a new one after wearing it every night for years. I love it"
'5'.'0',My wife (after using the mask for one night) said that this is the most comfortable sleep mask yet. Hopefully it stays as comfortable long term.,Excellent for a prisoners last rites
'5'.'0','Traditional?? sleep masks tend to pull at the eyes??this one does not. Comfy & blocks all the light. Love it.,Super soft and cozy. No complaints! Sleep like a baby with this.
'5'.'0',So comfortable,This sleep mask saved me on a trip. Its like wearing a soft hug around your face.
'5'.'0',"These sleep masks cover the ears as well as the eyes, so muffle the sound.  They come with ear plugs.  Light is cut out completely.  I have bought three (3) and given to family for airplane trips.  They have been as thrilled with them as I have. They are so soft and comfortable.  You wont be disappointed.",Small opening at the bottom
'5'.'0',"A foolish resistance fighter tried to breach the southern wall. We caught them using a combination of ancient Mayan hunting tactics and gutteral moaning, much like a wet bat trying to find food during a rainstorm. We captured them and blindfolded them using these. The prisoners lasted a brief period before falling asleep. We couldnt wake them, no matter how we tried, until morning.We believe these to be exceptional eye masks.",It works its way up my long blonde hair. I have to keep pulling it down all the time.
'5'.'0',Very soft and mine came with ear plugs too.,Worth the money. Love it and is so soft.
'4'.'0',Very soft. Comfortable. Doesnt slip off while sleeping.,Velcro fastener is poor quality
'4'.'0',"Small opening at the bottom so not a complete black out, but that didnt matter to me.",Great for side or stomach sleepers and will block out all the light. I wouldnt necessarily recommend it if you sleep on your back though since thats where the velcro straps come together so its like your head is resting a big lump.
'4'.'0',"Warm, soothing sleep! Soft, breathebable and comfortable fit!","This is by far the best sleep mask Ive owned, with one exception. Its comfortable, warm, soft, etc. But unfortunately, the velcro fastener has stopped working. :(UPDATE 1: Ive tried contacting the seller, but have not received any response.UPDATE 2: January 11, 2021: Seller contacted me today, offering a full refund or a new mask. The velcro should have held up longer, but at least they seem to be standing behind it."
'4'.'0',Great mask but velcro wore out fast,Once opening the box you can see how soft it is! As soon as you open it you cant help but feel how soft and surprisingly cold it feels. Dont worry its a good cold especially during warm nights. first night i tried it i fell asleep in about 5 mins! havent fallen asleep like that since junior high it honestly has fixed not only my sleeping schedule for the better but has fixed my mood throughout the whole day. Naps are never gonna be the same lol oh and it came with a pair of ear plugs in a little soft baggy.
'4'.'0',"Okay so this thing is amazingly soft, blocks out all light, and is pretty great. Im glad I purchased it and it really helps when the sun comes thru my skylights at 6am. HOWEVER, the most absolutely infuriating and annoying thing is","I love how the product actually doesnt cause any ear pain from it being close to your ears, as well as how you barely feel it there when it is on. It does a great job at being very comfortable and works well. My biggest issue is the fact it moves side to side a bit too often. Also the velcro on the back will attach to fleece based items. Found out the hard way when I went to bed and it stuck to my pillow.If there was a way to cover the excess of the velcro I would give it a 5 star easy. Otherwise a strong 4 star."
'4'.'0',"Solid product. It's very comfortable.My only complaint is that the Velcro wears out quickly. I've had 3 in 18 months, yet I keep ordering them.","Pros:  very comfortable and soft, blocks out light well, adjustable strapCons:  slides around on my head all night, constantly readjusting, comes off every night.This is a nice mask but it doesn't work for me.  Maybe I move around too much or it's because I sleep on my side, but this mask will not stay on my head throughout the night.  Even if I tighten it up so that it loses the comfort level, it slips off.  Might be good for someone who sleeps on their back and doesn't move around night, but for me the search continues."
'4'.'0',"Love this mask, but a little over two months in and the velcro has stopped working,",Comfy. But it doesnt clean off very well.
'4'.'0',Changed my sleeping habit!,Just what I was looking for
'4'.'0',Barely feel it there but moves side to side a lot.,"Soft and cool, but does slip out of place"
'4'.'0',Nice mask but not for me,mixed results or a side sleeper
'4'.'0',"Super Comfortable, Easy to Clean Mask","Im a fan! Its a nice mask, very comfortable, very soft. Im not sure if I love having something covering my ears, but thats a me thing, not a problem with the mask. Arrived punctually, and I like the little case  free ear plugs :)"
'4'.'0',"Very nice quality, but it tends to fall off when I sleep.",I love this. It's super comfortable and I washed and dried it in the washer with clothes which I don't think is recommended but it's been fine. Only drawback is the color... I have oily skin and often use a retinol face oil before bed and the fabric darkens because of this. I know I can't be the only one with this issue. I saw another review wishing it coming in black and I second this suggestion so that the dark Gray doesn't discolor. Otherwise.. it's comfortable and keeps it dark enough for me at night.
'4'.'0',Super soft and lightweight. Great compared to count our masks that are hard for sleepers that move in the eye sockets.This is very comfortable to wear and hardly notice it's on until you open your eyes,I love how big it is.  It covers half your face so you know its not going to ride up while you sleep.  But all that fabric is stifling if its not ice cold in your bedroom.  Just something to consider.  The quality was great and well stitched and made of very soft cotton that felt luxurious.
'4'.'0',I am VERY particular about sleep masks,"Overall, happy with the purchase."
'4'.'0',"overall its a solid product, blocks out nearly all light, comfortable, and soft. downside is the velcro combined with side sleeping. if you sleep on one side and depending on your head size, the velco will be between your head and the pillow. if you have a firmer pillow, the material will compress and that velcro will be felt directly on the side of your head and lightly stab you. its not really bad, but pretty uncomfortable on my perferred sleeping side and was irritating enough to keep me from being able to fall asleep.",Comfortable and does the job well.
'4'.'0',Great,"The fabric isnt 100% lightproof...Id say like 98%? Which is still great! I love that the fabric is cooling, and the straps dont hurt my ears. It is so comfortable, and I feel like Ive gotten the best nights sleep from this. Sometimes I wake up because it seems to slide off in my sleep? But nevertheless, a game changer for me.The one star is deducted because of some light still leaking through and maybe the strap isnt strong enough to keep it from falling off my head...AND I wish I had gotten the ""Sysrion Sleep Eye Mask"" which can also be found here on Amazon, but at a cheaper price at seemingly similar value."
'4'.'0',This was the best sleep mask I have ever used. I have this in July  2021. Why dont they put the reviews by date. The value will be by product and review date.,"As a side sleeper this is my favorite mask yet, but it is too hot for the summer months."
'4'.'0',Soft and comfortable but HOT,"If you stay cool while sleeping, absolutely this will work well for you.  Post-menopause I am very warm while sleeping and this mask had me waking up soaked in sweat.  Excellent quality, good product, just not great for my situation."
'4'.'0',light still kinda peeps through the bottom and even through the mask itself when the light is bright enough. use in conjunction with curtains and it's great. also i like having my ears covered. i will say not great for acne because it does cover your whole forehead.,Great for people with big heads!
'4'.'0',"It's surprisingly pretty comfortable. I am extremely particular about how I sleep, even a little disruption in comfort will keep me up all night. I was struggling to find a sleeping mask that didn't bother my ears (I'm a side sleeper). This one has been the best so far!The only real downfall I've encountered is because I have fairly oily skin on my face. This thing is like a super oil absorber, so I can really only wear it twice before it needs to be washed. And when I wash it, laundry detergent alone doesn't do the trick, so I have to use some Dawn dish soap with it.It says to hand wash it, but I throw it in the washing machine and dryer with normal loads all the time. It's held up pretty well so far.","Its super soft and pretty overall comfortable, I just wish there were extra space in the eye area"
'4'.'0',"Very comfortable, I was worried it might be hit with some much coverage, but it stays cool and does a great job blocking light.","Seriously this thing is amazing, and its the only mask Ive had that doesnt hurt my eyes to wear.Only problem is the Velcro in the back. Its way too strong for its relatively weak stitching, and after a few wash cycles the stitching has almost completely come undone. Im going to have to stitch it back on properly, or get a new one, and Ive only had it maybe two months"
'4'.'0',Good for side sleepers,"It is really soft and all, but the nose part is a bit uncomfortable for me."
'4'.'0',Very comfortable but very warm,"I have to have complete darkness when I sleep, so when I bought this mask I had high expectations. The mask is very comfortable, however the Velcro on the back can be annoying at times. It does block out a good deal of light, but not around the nose area. Also, when you see reviews stating that the velcro loses its adhesive grip, they are 100% correct. After washing it got a little better, but after months of having it the velcro is not holding as well as it did before. If you are prone to sweating in your sleep, I do not recommend this mask. The Cotten is soft and comfortable, but can make your face hot during the night. I don't regret this purchase, however I do not believe it is worth $24 and would not purchase this item again. Try it out if you are curious and have the money, other than that this might not be the sleep mask for you.Ps. It makes my eyebrows hurt! Like when your hair has been in a ponytail all day and you take it out."
'4'.'0',"This is probably the best sleeptime related purchase Ive made. Im an incredibly light sleeper that needs complete darkness and silence to sleep and stay that way.This sleep mask is wide enough that it covers my eyes and most of my forehead; when I wear it theres zero light getting through. Its incredibly soft and doesnt rub my skin wrong. It secures with a thick velcro strap at the back. If you have curly hair, Id recommend sleeping with it piled on top of your head in a loose bun so the sleep mask doesnt flatten the top layer and ruin your volume or curl pattern the next day. Since it wraps around the head, it does cover my ears.It definitely doesnt block out sound but it does muffle enough that theyre not annoyances. If you have a partner that snores obnoxiously Id say pair the mask up with some ear plugs.My one complaint is that the fabric is likely to stain if you have oily skin or do a nighttime skin care routine. I myself have a bedtime routine that I top off with moisturizer, and I noticed a slight darkening on the front portion of the mask where it touches my skin. To help combat this, I wash the mask once a week in a delicate bag and havent noticed the dark portion worsening. It also helps to make sure it doesnt get too stretched out. This could be a complete non","Super comfy, and a great fitBut I found light still came through the nose.. thats the major downside.Wouldnt recommend for anyone looking for a 100% black out"
'4'.'0',"Extremely pleasant, soft cotton material. This is the first time I have had a wrap a sleep mask around my eyes like this. It was bit odd at first but you get used to it after a while. A big pro is that it fits comfortably on people with larger heads like me!","This is a good sleeping mask. Its comfortable, adjustable, and blocks light very well. Ive already bought two and Im about to buy a third.Some downsides to the mask:1) While it never gets hot, on warm days it is less comfortable. After all, its wrapped around your face & will block any cooling you may want.2) Not machine washable. After a year of washing, the hooks&loops stop working.3) Doesnt always stay in place, this mask sometimes rides around my head so that my eyes dont line up with the masks eye-things. Not a deal breaker because the whole mask is comfortable anyway."
'4'.'0',Best sleep mask Ive ever owned... But...,"Very comfortable and soft, but does not muffle any sound. Great sleep mask however."
'4'.'0',Not bad but could be better,"It blocks out 90% of the light except around my nose. Its very soft, and doesnt make me overheat or want to pull it off in my sleep. It did get very gross very fast and the fabric on the back tore around the Velcro. I will likely buy again anyway."
'4'.'0',"I don't regret buying, but would not replace it","Extremely soft fabric that covers eyes well, blocks light completely and is very comfortable on the front. The strap at the back is a little thick and takes some getting used to because it props the head up a little if you use a firmer pillow. A thinner back strap would make this flawless."
'4'.'0',"Very Comfortable, But Leaks Light","Most comfortable of many sleep masks I tested.Material very soft.Nose area, mostly stops light coming in. Probably better for people with flatter noses.Back strap is too thick if you are sleeping on your back, so it digs into back of head. Not very comfortable whixh is kinda the opposite of helping you sleep."
'4'.'0',"Very, very comfy, but not a perfect black","The only part I didnt like about this mask is where the velcro joins at it is fairly uncomfortable if youre a back sleeper (which I am part of the night).  As such, I usually only use this mask as the light starts creeping in the window."
'4'.'0',"Good mask, some downsides",The sleep mask was soft but it covers from top of forehead to tip of nose. The Velcro closing is strong but a little bulky if you sleep on the back of your head. Not a bad product just not as comfortable as I prefer.
'4'.'0',Does Not Muffle Sound,"Its comfortable and has the right geometry to cover everything and block the light, but it covers your ears, so you might start to get hot in your sleep."
'4'.'0',"Works well, doesnt last long.","The fabric is very soft. However it does hold heat a bit, so it may not be suitable for warmer climates or hot sleepers. A little bit of light does come in through the bottom, but this could just be because I have a large nose lol. If I could change one thing, I would add a bit of extra stuffing or a liner because light still gets through the fabric. Its not a problem for me, but if you need absolute darkness this mask might not be enough. I love the wide shape of this mask and the material. I might just alter the mask myself to make it block out more light..."
'4'.'0',Soft fabric that blocks all light,"The mask in itself is fantastic, I had to replace the velcro with a better one a few weeks after getting it. Hope they make it better someday."
'4'.'0',Best of many bad sleep masks,very cool and doesnt press on the eyes much
'4'.'0',"Decent, but potentially uncomfortable for back sleepers.","Comfortable and works well. Ear plugs that come with it are not great, but in terms of blocking out light, this does a great job."
'4'.'0',"I have a small head so most head gears of any kind usually do not fit. This has incredibly long fastening strips so it could probably fot any head out there. The mask section is very large and covers my eyes,cheaks, forhead comfotably. It is padded enough that it doesnt press on my eyes or have gaps letting light irritate me or cause any air restrictions. The wide strap also lets me keep tight without discomfort or digging in. Also very easy to clean. I chuck it in with my shirts and it has held up great. The only draw back is that all of the features that make it so darn comfortable also put it a bit on the warm side but i believe when this one finally wares out i will replace it with the same product. Maybe try dif color but thats all id swap.",Comfortable looks goofy
'4'.'0',Dont like that it covers my ears,"COmfortable, but not for someone who has severe dry eye"
'4'.'0',"I've had this sleep mask for less than a year. I love the size, softness and blackout quality the best.After a few machine washing's though the Velcro began to wear out,  very  disappointing.","I don't often leave reviews on items I purchase on Amazon (never actually), however, this face mask deserved a shout out.I'm adverse to black out shades because I love natural light and the look of sheer curtains. Living in Florida and bedroom window facing east, I had to find a comfortable eye mask to block out the streaming light at 6am. I normally hate eye masks because they never stay on, elastic is uncomfortable, eyelashes smushed, etc.This eye mask is SUPER comfortable and soft and truly does it's job blocking out all light.HOWEVER, I've only used it for a few months and the Velcro no longer sticks, at all, and I'm currently browsing for a new one. The Velcro became 'unsticky?? after just a few weeks, and within a few months, does not even close or stay on.Planning to get the same concept eye mask because it's perfect but trying a different brand this time that hopefully uses better quality Velcro??"
'4'.'0',"Very soft, But not a total blackout mask","Very comfortable and mostly stays put, but it stretches a lot"
'4'.'0',Please make the velcro better!,Super soft and rather comfortable for sleep
'4'.'0',This might have worked but it was a bit bulky. I needed something a bit more sleek. Might be great for sidesleepers.,I get migraines sometimes and need to lay down for a couple of hours to sleep it off. I usually have to put my head under the blanket to block out light. This sleep mask is game changer! So soft and comfortable!!
'4'.'0',this doesnt have the cups to separate from the eyes but the bands are so wide that you really dont notice the pressure. The material is really cool temp wise and very very comfortable. The nose slot is of course not form fitting so a little light can get in through the bottom but I still prefer this because i turn in my sleep and like to lie sideways and this doesnt get tugged off my eyes like the ones with the normal little stripes.,"Its a nice product, smell nice, very soft touch. The only thing is it has a velcro strip behid that can be a little unconfortable."
'4'.'0',I have ptsd and use this for naps as needed.  I wear it over my full face clap mask with no problem.It would be perfect for me if it was weighted.,It's great but I'm sure there's better out there
'5'.'0',Everything about this item is wonderful,"All the other masks come off somehow but this is the only mask that stayed on my head. Its very soft, we shall see how it holds up after a few washes"
'5'.'0',"I've been literally been through a dozen sleep masks in search of the right balance of light blocking, comfortability on the eyes and nose, and a strap that doesn't annoy my ears or leave a mark. (For the record, I have a shaved head, so I'm likely more sensitive to the strap issues I've encountered)While I do wish this mask was a touch thicker and that I didn't feel any pressure on my eyes whatsoever, the fact is I've finally found the best overall balance of all necessities.Light blocking",This sleep mask is exactly what I was looking for. I like my ears to be covered when I am falling asleep and sometimes its too warm to pull the sheet/blanket all the way up. I love how soft this mask is and I love how large it is. There is some sort of light padding inside the two layers of cotton. The velcro is easy to adjust. It does tend to slide up and off my head in the middle of the night but I dont mind because I just use it to help me fall asleep quickly. My only complaint is that it must be hand washed. Unfortunately my night time face creams have rubbed off onto the mask and hand washing isnt sufficient in getting it off. I am going to have to machine wash it and hope it comes through ok!
'5'.'0',Comfortable to wear and blocks all light. Doesnt get caught on hair. No chemical smell.,Love it...  first one lasted 6 months (is that good or bad?) ordering another now.
'5'.'0',"I have bought almost a dozen sleep masks, trying to find one that blocks light while also being comfortable with multiple cartilage piercings. Most masks get caught or press on the ears, either due to the design or due to shifting during sleep. This mask does neither. It fits over a larger surface area than other masks (covering my entire ears, forehead, and temples), but is a soft jersey fabric that doesnt yank or irritate.It does soak up moisture quite easily, so I will be buying several pieces in order to start a washing rotation. People who sweat heavily or have an oily complexion may want to do the same.",Its great and comfortable to sleep in but I do notice some light coming in near my nose. Its manufacturered for a low bridge or an Asian fit. I wouldve liked for the nose area to be cut different for different nose shapes.
'5'.'0',This is the best sleep mask I've ever had. Very comfortable & blocks out all the light.,"This sleep mask is very well made, and not heavy to wear. It is also easily packable on trips. It washes up really well, by hand or machine. It blocks excess light that might otherwise keep one from falling asleep. About the only con I have had is that, during warmer months it may cause you to sweat more when sleeping. But if you need a mask to block the light, this  works well, and is comfortably light weighted."
'5'.'0',This is a game changer for me!  Since Ive been using the mask Ive had the most fulfilling sleep Ive had in a while.  Im actually mad that I didnt invest in this particular mask sooner.  Great product!,"HEY POTATO HEADS!!!This is it this is the one.  Its not perfect but its almost perfectThe not-so-good first, the velcro enclosure could be a little bit tighter.  also it gets flimsy with age these arent designed to last forever about 3 months.  But considering one to two months is as good as Ive ever add sleep masks last this is doing better than they are.About the good witch makes it worth buying:. It is very soft it fits large heads it might actually be too large for smaller or average heads but the velcro in back is very long so its got a huge range of adjustability so I would imagine anywhere from big up old potato heads like me all the way down to little girls.The fabric is extremely soft it does slightly put pressure on your eyelids but its easy to get used to it can be kind of stretchy and they are not kidding when they say you must hand wash this and lay it out to dry dont even put it in the dryer on cool wash it on cool laying out to dry even still its going to start to fall apart but youll get a good three or four months out of it at leastWhat I can do is it sits just above my nose and it goes all the way up to almost passed my forehead and then from side-to-side it covers my ears it covers my forehead it completely covers my ears and it attaches to the velcro in back kind of low not up on the back of my head but low on the back of my head you can get it as tight or as loose as you want.it doesnt really stretch the fabric stretches out over time but it is not stretch fabric so you may feel a little claustrophobic if you have a tendency to thatAll in all its not been any sort of problem for me it completely blacks out any light and with disposable ear plugs in my ears I never hear anything nor see any light peeking throughall in all its very comfortable especially for guys who have great big potato heads this is the one you should be getting if hats dont fit you or any of the other stuff doesnt fit you.Recommended and I will be buying from them from now on out. I have been extremely pleased"
'5'.'0',"I sleep in a room with a ton of windows and its very bright. Unlike others, this sleep mask actually stays on y our head when you roll over on your side when asleep. It blocks out enough light to make it seem like you are in the dark. It fits comfortably over your nose and the strap in the back for a snug fit.My only con with this mask is after washing it, I had to readjust the head strap but you cant even call it a con since there is velcro","Really soft, I love that it doesn't leave marks on my face. It doesn't block the light as well as other masks I've used."
'5'.'0',This mask is so comfortable. It can be rolled up so it's compact for traveling. It's lightweight enough for comfort but not too much that it falls off your face. Great price too! It feels like good quality and should last some years of frequent use.,"Great sleep mask, but gets hot after a while"
'5'.'0',"This is the best eye mask ever. I purchased one a few years ago and bought another two for my parents. They love it, too.","Can get warm and it moves around a lot compared to the fake silk wrap around one I used to have. I do not really recommend it compared to the same style one made of a more silky material. Also, not well defined area for the nose."
'4'.'0',Very good face mask,"Soft, puffy material and a storage pouch make this superior to the usual, cheap sleep mask (the flat kind).The lightweight, fluffy material doesnt have much presence, and theres no pressure on the front of your face.The long velcro strip on this mask allows easy adjustment, but I found it baaarely fits on my L/XL (hat-size) noggin. If youre XL (or larger) hat-sized, this will likely be too small for you.The storage pouch is nice-- no more dusty mask from your nightstand pressed into your face, or commingled with the junk in your travel carryon. It squishes down to go back into the pouch with minimal effort.The downsides? The limited size for those of us with big heads, and its much more expensive than the flat type of mask. That aside, its pretty decent."
'4'.'0',"It's soft and comfortable to wear, unfortunately the material doesn't block 100% of the light. It works for light coming from electronics in a dark room, but if you need it for blocking light in a well light room get something else.",Not for summer nights
'4'.'0',"Large, soft and comfortable","Used this sleep mask for awhile now and can say its quiet good actually, the only down side is the feeling when u sleep side ways but once u sleep it wont bother u, after all u cant find better than this in my opinion in this price, worth having specially when u go camping or traveling."
'4'.'0',"I recently upgraded from a cheap $5 mask so this was a massive improvement as far as comfort goes. I love how soft this mask is. I think it does a great job, the only reason it doesnt hit a 5 star is because it does still let some light in as well as the light will shine through the mask. So its not a complete blackout when wearing it, but it does a good enough job that its benefits outweigh its negatives. I havent used it with the ear plugs but I would imagine with how comfortable the mask is around the ears as well as how it would help keep the earplugs in all night I imagine it would work great. Overall great product.",Lightweight comfy but...
'4'.'0',Comfortably Light and Packs Well,Uncomfortable For Lying On Back for MRI or Back Sleeper
'4'.'0',HEY POTATO HEADS THIS IS IT THIS IS THE ONE!!!!!!!,Velcro stopped sticking
'4'.'0',Comfy but doesn't block enough light,"Owned this for about 9 mo and 2 mo ago the velcro function stopped sticking together, so the mask falls off while sleeping, not sure if its because I washed it but otherwise worked well for the 1st 6 mo just dont hand wash/line dry! Hence the 3 star review, not good if you want it to last."
'4'.'0',Great sleep mask,Great until the velcro goes out
'4'.'0',Can get warm and it moves around a lot compared to the fake silk wrap around one I used to have.,Sleeping in this is like sleeping inside a Furnace ????
'4'.'0',Really comfortable and easy to use. Blacks out any light in the room and straps cover the ears to quite the room.,very nice but not blackout
'4'.'0',"It is a little wide for my face and slightly tight over my eyes even after adjusting, but still comforable enough.",Velcro came off within a single month of use
'4'.'0',Really soft and well crafted. The Velcro's section is even a bit reinforced which will definitely add to the life of it. It's large enough to fit around my head and my thick hair while comfortably covering my ears as well. Excellent buy!,Velcro gave out super fast
'4'.'0',"This mask has ALMOST all components for me to be top of the line. It's soft, and fitted to your standards with the Velcro strap. However, the Velcro strap does not last. Mine won't fasten any longer without pulling it so tight it's uncomfortable. FIX the Velcro and it will be perfect!","Get loose after a while, Doesn't provide noise reduction even though it covers the ears"
'3'.'0',I sleep hot and this made me hotter. At first i liked it then found myself returning to the smaller more traditional sleep mask.,"If you live in a cold-weather climate this is a great item to have when you sleep at night, but during the warmer summer months, if your room doesnt have AC, you will find your head boiling because the fabric will trap yourheat. It works as intended, but it feels uncomfortable when it is warm."
'3'.'0',"I got this for an MRI lying on my back.  It would not work for that because there is an uncomfortable lump where the face mask overlaps with velcro right at the back of the head.  So, I used a random cheap mask they had available at the imaging center.  So, my plans were a fail.  I also cant use it for sleeping because I sleep on my back.  And I cant sleep with a bump right behind my head where the mask overlaps with the velcro.This was not designed well for lying on ones back.  But, it might be great for side sleepers or stomach sleepers or I guess if there is an MRI where you arent lying on your back.",It works for the first few months. The velcro strip invariably fails over time. Im thinking of modifying it to ensure a snug fit.
'3'.'0',"Ive tried many eye covers and this by far worked the best for me until..the velcro stopped sticking a few months into the purchase which ultimately made it unusable. If it wasnt for the velcro malfunction, I would have given it a 5  star.",The Velcro on the back got damage/weak within a few weeks of use. Now the mask doesn't stay in place. Disappointing
'3'.'0',Only lasted about 6 mo,Lasted less than a year
'3'.'0',"I sleep with an eye mask every night and spent a long time looking for the one I wanted to buy to replace my current one. I was excited by the reviews for this one, but unfortunately it was very uncomfortable. If I put it on tightly enough that it wouldnt fall off in the night it gave me a headache, but if I made it looser it just slid right off. Also, even when I wore it loosely, my eyebrows were very irritated in the morning (like how your hair feels if you wear a ponytail all day). I should have returned it, but it didnt feel worth going through the trouble. I have put it in the ""giveaway"" basket and will try to rehome it soon.",This provided better sleep quality but would have liked it to offer more darkness as the light still goes through.
'3'.'0',This was great until the velcro stopped working. The velcro is a great idea because most sleep masks dont fit my small head. I bought two within 6 months. They didnt last too long.,"At first I thought this was the best sleep mask I ever owned. After a couple washes it doesn't stay in place, the velcro in the back doesn't stay fastened, and the mask rolls up exposing eyes to light"
'3'.'0',"My room is pretty chilly at night, and I am pretty col while sleeping, but even so","These are fabulous - super soft, totally darkening, like a warm cocoon for your eyeballs. But the Velcro wears out really fast. We have three of these - even our kid wanted one! And the Velcro stopped working on all of them in less than a year. Perhaps this is because we wash them, but um, you should wash them."
'3'.'0',"If this was advertised as a sleep mask, I would give 5 stars.Since it was advertised as a BLACKOUT sleep mask, I give it 3 stars.Its soft, comfortable, intelligent use of the velcro, and stays on while sleeping. It does not need an eye cup since it is very comfortable with your eyes and lashes.BUT, if you are looking for a blackout mask, be aware that this is, at best, is a grey","So I thought Id love this mask.  Ever since I started using sleep masks, this one has been hands down the best.  The problem is it didnt last as long as my previous masks.I love how big this mask is.  I have a very big head, so its not easy finding things that fit around it.  This mask is one of those rare exceptions.  The material is also very cool and soft around my face.The problem is, even though its most comfortable sleep mask Ive ever used...its also had the shortest lifespan.  I bought this at the end of May.  So Ive been using it since June.  June-October.  Five months.  The velcro is already wearing out and not holding together anymore.  The past few nights now, I would put the mask on and it would immediately loosen, unfasten, and fall off; taking 2-3 attempts before I could get the velcro to stick."
'3'.'0',"The softness of the eye mask was certainly up to the mark. However, the velcro that holds the mask together while you sleep lost its stickiness within 45 days of use, resulting in a mask that doesnt stay on while sleeping.For the price, I expected something that would last longer.","This mask is pretty good, its really soft and comfortable. However if you are using it when theres light in the room, you will see it is not completely opaque and some light comes through. Also there is a small dot of light coming in from the bottom of the mask"
'3'.'0',"To be fair, many of the rooms set high expectations that I was about to revolutionize my sleep.  Id say my sleep is slightly better, but not always noticing so.It is soft, and does well enough blocking out light. It stays on better than traditional masks.My concerns:","Most comfortable mask, but hot."
'3'.'0',"Idk if I got a defective one? But not long after the Velcro totally gave out. I like a snug fit with eye masks so it no longer worked for me at all. When it did, it was sooo comfortable and soft.","I dont know if there is something strange about my eyebrows, but this thing really hurts them!  I have tried loosening it, but that doesnt help. Nothing else has ever made my eyebrows hurt, and I cant even tell why its happening! Other than that, this sleep mask is perfect."
'3'.'0',Gets hot when you sleep at night. Feels like wrapping your head in a blanket.,Seems comfortable but have not been able to use it yet as it came perfumed and I need to wash and dry it to get the smell out.  It does seem like it will block light well.  But perfume ?
'3'.'0',Great mask that doesnt last due the velcro strip wearing out over time.,It blocks out all the light
'3'.'0',Velcro on the mask is bad,"I bought this as a present for my son, so I really dont know first hand, however he tells me it is exactly what he wanted."
'3'.'0',It completely blocks out the light but I found that it moved when I changed positions dk the nose part was sideways when I woke up and when I tried to tighten the Velcro it felt right around my eyes. So it can't really be adjusted without any discomfort.,Love the wrap style sleep mask and the soft material. Stretches way too easily though
'3'.'0',Bought June 2020. This sleep mask started out great,Best mask ive used to date
'3'.'0',"While this did eliminate light I was always having to adjust it, particularly around my noseEventually I gave up and took it offIt was also very warm",Secure sleeping eye mask
'3'.'0',"Great, while the velcro lasts",Stretches out too much
'4'.'0',"Really love the wrap around style of this sleep mask and the material is soft and comfortable. Does its job blocking out light. Only complaint is that the fabric stretches very easily.After a couple of nights use, the fabric starts to stretch out and does so progressively with each use. Because the mask is fastened by velcro, the stretching means that you have to fasten it further and tighter each night to the point where im running out of clearance with the velcro and i have 3",So soft and comfy but gets SO HOT that I wake up sweating
'4'.'0',The velcro is super heavy duty. Overall the mask is very well made. The ear plugs that came with it are a nice little bonus. Only thing i would change would be to add extra padding around the nose to block out 100% of the light. But definatly still a great purchase,"I consider myself a connoisseur of sleep masks. Ive had this one on my wishlist and when I lost my eye mask during travel, I though this would be a perfect purchase. I was really hoping to like this one as it was very comfortable and soft but after a couple weeks of usage, Ive given up.The pros are that its very comfortable and soft. It keeps out a decent amount of light (not totally black out but then again Ive never found one that is, light can still get in the nose area, especially when youre laying down). The biggest con is that, because of the size, this thing moves around SO much. Ive woken up and had it completely twisted on my head several times throughout the night. Also, its difficult to tighten it without a lot of overlap on the velcro.Alas, my search for the perfect sleep mask continues."
'4'.'0',comfortable and soft,The mask is soft and breathable and definitely helps with sleep.I would give it five stars but I have to dock two for the fact that the velcro wears out far too quickly - the manufacturer should look to switch it out for a different velcro that is more durable.
'4'.'0',"This is a different type of eye mask compared to your typical nylon band ones. This is very secure, but does go all the way around your head, and covers your ears too. A little different sensation, but not bad. I will update this after more use, but so far so good.","Why did I wait so long to buy this. Amazing!!Im a bald guy and I work on a  offshift this is amazing and it comes with ear plugsUpdate: was very much enjoying till velcro starting wearing out, not holding very frustrating!!"
'4'.'0',Ive bought two of these because I love them so much but I dont think Ill buy again.  It stretches out and becomes uncomfortable to wear. New it fit perfectly and I didnt even get to the end of the Velcro. Now theres 4,This product let in a lot of light from around my nose bridge and also through the actual fabric. I found there was zero dampening of sounds with this item when worn without the ear plugs. I do think the item stays on well and is comfortable. I wish I had purchased the item in black for better blockage of light.
'4'.'0',It works well and comfortable.,"This was just ok for me. It was my first sleep mask and I came to appreciate it. There were three issues I found: it slipped up my face at night. It became discolored where it was on my face from might moisturizers, even with washing every 4-7 days. And it smashed my lashes, causing them to grow in too curled. Like that's possible. But it was too much for me and my mascara rubbing off on my eyelids in the day! Had to move on to a new mask with a curved cup over the eye, which has been great. I used this for about 4 months."
'4'.'0',"In my search for the perfect sleep mask, this is the best I found so far. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because it is too warm, although I might be grateful for that come winter, and because it takes so long to dry after washing. This mask does an excellent job of blocking out the light and not shifting around when I sleep.  I move a lot when sleeping,  and most masks shift too much, exposing my eyes. This mask is large enough that even if it does shift slightly, my eyes remain covered. In addition,  it doesnt leave marks on my face, which many masks do because they need to be tightened to keep them in place. And, whats very important to me, theres no metal or plastic to cut into my face or ears when shifting around when sleeping.  I wash it by hand once a week, but it takes a long time to dry. I started putting it in the dryer with my other laundry towards the end if the drying cycle, and that has helped.","I want to love this eye mask and give it 5 stars but even after buying a few of them the velcro strip has proven to be such a let down. The ""stickiness"" of the velcro decreases pretty quickly over time (within a couple weeks!) and I constantly have to re-velcro the strap around my head over and over. It comes loose when Im sleeping and/or slips up over my head. Thats the only reason why Im giving the product 3 stars. Otherwise its super soft and does a great job blocking light. Im currently looking for a competitive product but based on the product photos of competitors it looks like everybody is using this same velcro manufacturer."
'4'.'0',Very soft and comfortable not hot at all.,"Nice product, but not completely light-blocking"
'4'.'0',The velcro is super heavy duty. Overall the mask is very well made. The ear plugs that came with it are a nice little bonus. Only thing i would change would be to add extra padding around the nose to block out 100% of the light. But definatly still a great purchase,"I bought this eye mask about 9 months ago. The material is super soft and comfortable. It does put a little pressure on the eyes but it is not uncomfortable; I actually like the gentle pressure for some reason (maybe because of a weighted blanket-like feeling on the eyes). My major complaint, and the reason for the 3 stars, is the lack of durability. Within 9 months the fabric had frayed and the Velcro has lost its stickiness, making this unusable. I expected more durability for the price tag. I bought a cheaper one ($13) that is just as comfortable. At least if that one becomes unusable in 9 months, I wont feel ripped off."

After 9 months, the velcro stopped working, and it wont fasten together. I loved this mask, and it helped me get sleep that I was unable to get for years. Im disappointed that it didnt even last 1 year."
'3'.'0',Soft and really helps me sleep... only reason for 3 star was the velcro stopped sticking only a month after purchase... didnt bother telling company just pinned it together with safety pins,"It's hard to find a mask that doesn't press on my eyeballs, is good for side sleepers, and blocks out the light. This checks off 2 of those boxes, but doesn't block out the light under my nose. I didn't want to return it and wait for a different one to come in, so I hacked it to make it suit my needs. I cut up the small satchel it came with and sewed blinders on the bottom of this mask. Now it's a great mask that checks all boxes. I hope the manufacturers see this review and consider changing the design to implement these simple blinders, because, what's the point of a sleep mask if it doesn't block out the light? Aside from the light issue, the mask is super comfortable and soft, and really does work well for side sleepers."
'3'.'0',Dont purchase if youre a tosser and turner.,Velcro wears out quickly - 3 months nightly use

It was better, but not great, when I first purchased it but it has now gotten to the point where it is almost unusable because it doesn't stay closed and comes off when I'm sleeping. Very disappointing and at this price, I wouldn't recommend."
'3'.'0',"I've has this mask since February. Initially I loved it. Fits, blocks almost all light, comfortable, soft. Sadly, the velcro fastener is not strong & wore out very quickly.

Not rebuying.","I never write reviews, but I needed to for this item.  This is the second one of these that I have bought in a fairly short amount of time.  The mask is so soft and comfortable.  This big issue is that the velcro just doesnt last.  It is so frustrating.  After a month or so, it gets less strong then it starts actually waking you up because you have to continually fix and attempt to re-attach it  Now I have two of these and neither of them work.  It is such a bummer because, until it stops working, it really is awesome."
'3'.'0',The overlapping velcro straps in the back interferes with it being comfortable,"I really like this product - comfy and easy, but after 2 years the velcro no longer works at all and the cushioning/material has thinned so it no longer blocks as much light. Wish it would have had more longevity - so five stars to start with, but -2 for not being a longer-term investment (I hate waste so I try to purchase things that are maybe a little more money up front but with the hope they will last). Ive always babied it by washing in a delicates bag and hang drying."

I am not thrashing around my bed, most times I hardly move, but I find this always slips off or to the side. I do have to readjust upon waking. The other con - the Velcro wears out quickly, which is why I had to purchase this item again. It loses its toughness and then just stops sticking together."
'3'.'0',"Its soft, blocks the light, love how i can adjust the fit, but it is much thinner than i was expecting. No like comes through, but i do like to have a little weight on my eyes and thought the pictures made it look like it did. Still wear it though.",The mask is super soft and comfortable.

Unfortunately, after washing it the Velcro no longer stuck and the mask was useless. There wasn't a warning again washing it, which is obviously important. I tried reaching out to the consent but they weren't interested in communicating after the purchase was completed. Highly disappointed."
'3'.'0',"Almost, but not quite.","This mask was soft, comfy, and easily adjustable. Does a great job anchoring on the nose.

I really hoped it would work but it was not good.
'3'.'0',"Perfect, except one big flaw",May be good if you are a side sleeper who does not move
'3'.'0',I like this sleep mask a lot. My only issue is that it doesn't block the light well enough for me. I need 100% light blocking and the material lets some light sleep through.

'2'.'0',"I bought this thinking it will actually keep all the light out. The only thing is, this is a one size fits all kinda thing. So it kept sliding up and off my head. The velcro would kinda of stay attached, but it was uncomfortable to lay on. The material used was comfortable, but for normal to oily skin you can clearly see where your face was touching the mask. Like when you see the oil spot from that paper stuff at doctors offices.",Its very comfortable but it gets warm so the room had to be cold for me to use it well
'2'.'0',Might work for some but not me,"If this mask was shaped to stand away from ones eyelashes, it might just be perfect. Ideally, the cutout for the nose would be slightly bigger (taller), too. This mask is very soft, the strap is very comfortable. I just didnt like it pressing against my eyelashes.Im using the Alaska Bear sleep mask, but its strap is uncomfortable because the slip ring and strap stitching, that makes the strap length adjustable, lines up with my left ear and thats not great for a side sleeper.Id love to use this mask instead, but it needs some changes to work for me."
'2'.'0',"I would have loved it the very first time I put it on. The very first thing I noticed is it is very soft and very comfortable. And then there's the bulky velcro tape in the back of your head. During the course of my sleep, I woke up and found that it has already turned around my head, the velcro is already over my left ear","So I had another sleep mask, looks almost identical (different supplier) and it stayed soft and thick for over 5 years (and thats with washing it every 2 weeks or so). This one Ive had for less than a month and its flattened more than the one I had for 5 years. The lining below the eye isnt as full of stuffing either so light gets in easier. Too bad, I was hoping this one would be as good as the other one. Its a lot of money to pay for a product that doesnt work well from the beginning"
'2'.'0',"I mean, I guess it works. Its no more comfortable or effective than tying an old tee shirt around your head, which is something Ive done, and its certainly less cost effective, but its something around your head and over your eyes to block out light. Of course, itll change position while you sleep, and stop working, so theres that. It also sometimes causes me to wake up with a headache from the pressure, too.","Softest, most comfortable sleep mask I have ever worn. The Velcro wears out after a month or two of nightly use though and it no longer stays on."
'2'.'0',"I have tried sleeping with this for a few weeks  now.Pros:Soft enough that I dont feel it after a while.The shape around the nose allows for very effective face covering, far superior to the standard eye mask shape It doesnt move around much on its own (tossing and turning is another story)Cons:The velcro strips make the entire back side very thick, meaning if you want to sleep on your back this is probably not feasible. It does not bother you if you sleep on your side. However in my case sleeping on my side causes problems (tossing/turning, loss of circulation) and my goal is to block the light so I can sleep on my back better without waking up.The cottony softness isnt quite as pleasant as a more silky texture would be, but I am not sensitive enough to care personally.If you toss and turn at all it can completely rotate around so that the nose hole is behind your head.","I want to love this!! I had a similar one for a long time, but it needed to be replaced, so I tried this one based on the design and reviews.  but for me, it slips off my head every night, waking me up.  I have it as tight as it can go, which is very snug, so it is beyond me why it slips all the time. Have to find another option.It is so soft and when it is on, it does a great job with no letting light filter in, and even when it is tight, my eyes feel no pressure, so I really wish it would work for me!!"
'2'.'0',"This product is a 'darkening?? mask. It does not black out and if the sun comes through the blinds it will not be blocked out.For someone who needs black out, it won't do the trick.","Update January 13, 2023: after a few more months with this mask I have decided to update my review with some additional thoughts. Everything new will be designated with the * character. However, my initial rating of 3 stars will not change.I have had issues falling and staying asleep for my entire adult life, and I've tried a dozen different sleep masks. I've been using this sleep mask for six months now, and while I enjoy it enough to keep using it for the time being, I have some issues with it. That is to say, if I find something better, I will not hesitate to leave this one behind.Pros:1. The material is very soft and comfortable. I never had a problem with scratching or chafing anywhere. This is the most comfortable eye mask I've ever worn. * I've tried silk masks that are genuinely less comfortable than this one.2. No elastic band keeping the mask in place means nothing cutting or digging into your ears. * The light pressure of the mask wrapping around the ears might be really nice for some people - I definitely like it.3. Velcro strap is adjustable for heads of all sizes. * The velcro is also pretty wide so it's easy to line up and has worked well (lots of sticking) the entire time I've had the mask.* 4. The nose wing is narrower than I've seen on other masks, which means that it does block out a lot of light that might otherwise get in through the bottom.Cons:1. The mask does not provide a true blackout. Bright enough light (any kind of sunlight, including pre-dawn and post-dusk) will still get through the materials and into your eyes. With your eyes closed this effect is noticeable depending on the amount of ambient light, and some people may find this to be a major detractor.2. The Velcro strips are not placed well on the fabric. What I mean is that with the mask fitted tightly, the velcro strips will only overlap about 10-15%. If you overlap the strips perfectly, the mask would almost certainly not fit anyone. I don't have a really small head or anything so all the wasted velcro real estate strikes me as a design flaw. This has a side effect of leaving a long tail on the mask of unused velcro area that flops around.3. Slipping off overnight. I will still often wake up in the middle of the night and have to grope around in the dark for my mask, which has come off due to my tossing and turning. My restless sleeping is clearly a personal problem to begin with but the fact is the mask rarely stays on my head overnight.* 4. The lack of a black color option strikes me as a mistake. Being colored black might indeed help the mask to block out more light than the gray color.Notes:1. You have to wash this thing at least once a week or more to keep it clean. It absorbs face/skin/hair oil like mad and stains quite easily.2. The material will stretch over time with repeated use. This has certainly contributed to some of the problems I outlined above, but longevity of a product is a valid parameter to consider in a product. If you have a small head, you might have to buy a new mask within six months. * I have had to buy a new mask at this point because of the aforementioned reason. The velcro strips simply do not align anymore for me to wear the old mask at all tightly. I can wear it loosely but then it just slips right off.* 3. The mask does not offer any kind of noise reduction or anything. This is not advertised as one of the features so this wouldn't count as a con in my book.I give it 3/5 for being very comfortable and having a good idea for a design despite that design being flawed and the material not providing a total blackout as I had hoped."
'2'.'0',"As a night shift nurse, I've tried many face masks. This mask is super soft and one of the most comfortable ones I've tried. However, the velcro is already not holding together anymore. I received this face mask on January 17th and use it about 3 times week. So I've gotten less than 2 months wear out of it. I've attempted to contact the owners for a replacement, hoping the poor quality is a fluke but haven't had any luck making contact.","I wear sleep masks fairly often, and have I owned various models over the years. (I live in a city apartment where the light from the street finds its way through both blinds and curtains.)At first I loved this sleep mask, which I ordered in ""upgraded gray"". Its very comfortable and well-designed; theres just the right amount of padding below ones eyes to keep out light, and to leave space so that my eyelashes dont brush in a distracting way against the inside of the mask. The same cannot be said of other designs Ive tried.Heres the problem. After the first wearing, and more so after the second, the fabric became badly soiled by what I took to be normal facial oil. Im an adult, and have normal - not oily - skin. I dont use a moisturizer.The stain is unsightly, and would not come out!. I washed the mask several times, used a laundry stain pre-wash spray, and soaked the mask overnight in a strong solution of oxygen bleach. and nothing I tried made it better. It looks dirty.I liked the mask so much that I bought a second one, thinking that perhaps I had used some odd soap or other product on my skin before bed. For the second mask I was careful to wash with a hypoallergenic,""99.8%"" pure soap. The same stain appeared, and nothing after multiple attempts made it better.Ive never had an issue like this with any cloth that has ever touched my skin, including fabrics of model and silk. Im not a squeamish person, and I dont automatically recoil from objects which look soiled. I still use the mask sometimes, hoping that I may think of a new cleaning idea.Fortunately, after I put it on, my eyes are closed."
'2'.'0',The velcro is incredibly loose and had to return. Its too bad because the mask is extremely soft.,"This is one of the more comfortable and all around light-blocking masks Ive tried. The soft cotton construction doesnt press on your face. If you sweat a lot though, it will soak. Youll need to wash it from time to time. I havent had any of the staining or bleeding issues others have reported. The main reason I bought this one though, was besides the fact that it didnt have uncomfortable eye pillows, the newly redesigned Velcro looked better than traditional Velcro masks that eventually wear out.Well, it is different - its far worse and wore out to the point it would not stay on my face without 5-6 adjustments/night within the first month I had it. That stuff is useless. Id rather have the classic stuff. My next one I will be looking at designs that dont feature Velcro at all. Id buy another one IF it had a different fastening device on it."
'2'.'0',"I bought this thinking it will actually keep all the light out. The only thing is, this is a one size fits all kinda thing. So it kept sliding up and off my head. The velcro would kinda of stay attached, but it was uncomfortable to lay on. The material used was comfortable, but for normal to oily skin you can clearly see where your face was touching the mask. Like when you see the oil spot from that paper stuff at doctors offices.",Loved it till the Velcro failed
'2'.'0',Might work for some but not me,Velcro strap is uncomfortable when lying on my back
'2'.'0',"I would have loved it the very first time I put it on. The very first thing I noticed is it is very soft and very comfortable. And then there's the bulky velcro tape in the back of your head. During the course of my sleep, I woke up and found that it has already turned around my head, the velcro is already over my left ear","It works, sort of. I was hoping it was thicker. Unless it is positioned just right light leeks in from the bottom."
'2'.'0',"I mean, I guess it works. Its no more comfortable or effective than tying an old tee shirt around your head, which is something Ive done, and its certainly less cost effective, but its something around your head and over your eyes to block out light. Of course, itll change position while you sleep, and stop working, so theres that. It also sometimes causes me to wake up with a headache from the pressure, too.",Not bad but poor quality control.
'2'.'0',"I have tried sleeping with this for a few weeks  now.Pros:Soft enough that I dont feel it after a while.The shape around the nose allows for very effective face covering, far superior to the standard eye mask shape It doesnt move around much on its own (tossing and turning is another story)Cons:The velcro strips make the entire back side very thick, meaning if you want to sleep on your back this is probably not feasible. It does not bother you if you sleep on your side. However in my case sleeping on my side causes problems (tossing/turning, loss of circulation) and my goal is to block the light so I can sleep on my back better without waking up.The cottony softness isnt quite as pleasant as a more silky texture would be, but I am not sensitive enough to care personally.If you toss and turn at all it can completely rotate around so that the nose hole is behind your head.","This does a great job of keeping the light out and is so soft. Unfortunately, it makes me sweat and sometimes leaves lines on my face when I sleep on my side."
'3'.'0',"I was hopeful when I ordered this mask, but when I opened the package, I was surprised to see how asymmetrical it was, with one side of the nose having much more padding than the other. I tried it for one night, and sure enough, light crept in on the right side of my nose. I am returning it for a replacement in the hopes that this one was just a lemon. If the replacement is not better, Ill just return it for good.","This mask stays on and doesn't let light through the cracks like others. It's also soft. The problem is that so much light comes through the material, I wake up from it anyway. It's only suitable if you are already in a somewhat dark room. Don't expect it to help when you are traveling and trying to block out daylight."
'3'.'0',"Does not completely block out light from the TV or bright daylight.  It is, however, very comfortable and does help better than nothing","I was hoping to get a super breathable mask but this one was so hot that I had to take it off every night I wore it (a week). It definitely blocks out the light but if you sleep hot, I wouldn't recommend itUpdate - While I still stand behind my review, I have updated the rating to reflect the customer service of the company as they did reach out to see what they could do to make this a better overall experience."
'3'.'0',"I've had this mask for about a month now.  At first, I thought I had finally found the holy grail of sleep masks","It blocks the light, very comfortable and soft but, after about three weeks the Velcro stopped sticking to itself so it's very hard to keep on during the night"
'3'.'0',Lays right on the eyes,Wonderful - But stretches over time
'3'.'0',"Flattens, so is less soft and is less comfortable than others I have purchased in the past..","product material is pretty soft, the only problem is the odor, if you sweat while wearing it, it will absorb all your sweat and smells bad, I understand I can wash it, but i am afraid i cant wash it every single day after I use it"
'3'.'0',Amazing until velcro wore out,"I tend to mostly sleep on my side and stomach and this sleep mask works well for that application. It does a good job blocking the light and is relatively comfortable. My main problem with this is that after just one year of use, the velcro no long works and now these are utterly useless.Would not purchase again."
'3'.'0',Velcro stopped sticking,"The mask is very soft and definitely blocks out light. However, the Velcro is not very strong, and the mask comes off when I turn my head during sleep. Then I wake up to fix the mask. Not very helpful for people who struggle to stay asleep, but it may work well if your issue is falling asleep. It may work well for sleeping on a plane, too, where youre more upright and turn your head less often."
'3'.'0',Passable but not perfect,"Worked great for a month or two, then the Velcro wore out and now it wont stay attached throughout the night"
'3'.'0',"Several pluses, one big minus.","Soft and comfortable. You do not sweat but the material is thin. Light shines right through, not sure what the other reviews are about. Its like a sheet pressed on your face in regards to light coming right through. put the covers or a pillow in front and youre good. Update: velcro stops working in a month or two."
'3'.'0',"Comfortable, but the new Velcro has issues",Unpleasant Odor That Did Not Go Away
'3'.'0',This is a great mask that is very soft unfortunately being state of Florida with the climate it just doesn't work because it creates more heat around your forehead with our climate I had to take it off even with my fans going,doesnt sleep well... falls off and is very bulky. but it is soft
'3'.'0',This was exactly what I was looking for,I was really excited to open it- it is super soft. For some reason though- the velcro must be made for a giant to wear it on their head. I cant get it to stay on my head during the night because I have to make it tighter than what the velcro allows. Also- the fabric doesnt keep the light all the way out. I still have this one but most nights I resort to using my old one that is falling apart because it keeps the light out better and stays on my head.
'3'.'0',Velcro strap is uncomfortable when lying on my back which is how I sleep 90% of the time.  It was more comforable on my side.  It does not block out all of the light.  The earplugs are useless.  It does contact your eyelashes so can not use it with extensions.  There is no nose piece like shown in some of the pics on other reviews.  I am returning,Expensive and Uncomfortable
'3'.'0',Approximately five months and the Velcro has come off.  Can't seem to reach company and Amazon will not take back.  Just wanted an exchange.,"Its a comfortable mask that is nice and wide but I found that it constantly sliding off my face or coming apart in the middle of the night because of the narrow Velcro fasteners.  Maybe its because I sleep on my side?  Feels like the mask would be best used for those who sleep on their backs or for traveling.Edited - Lowered it down to 2 stars.  The thin, Velcro fasteners no longer work, making the mask practically useless."
'2'.'0',Mask comes off when you turn your head,"I like this sleep mask, but the velcro stopped sticking after a couple months. now I cant use it"
'2'.'0',Perfect until 1st wash,"This doesnt block out light completely unless your nose is probably large enough to cover the gap between the sleep mask and your nose. I didnt make it that tight but still felt pressure on my eyes because your eyes are literally directly touching the mask. Your eyelashes feel like theyre being smooshed, which is what I dislike about the cheap eye masks and this is definitely not cheap. Some have claimed this blocks out noise because it wraps around your ears but the volume with and without this mask sound relatively similar. The only pro is that its super soft."
'2'.'0',Worked well until Velcro wore out,"Ive tried many sleep masks over the years and was excited about this one. I felt confident that this was the sleep mask that was going to be a dream to sleep with.In the beginning, the velcro was aggressive to work with. Once it was on, it was really on! You cant slip it up either if you want to glance at something. It can also be very loud when you pull the velcro apart to take it off which did disturb my wife. Dont worry though, in about a month of nightly use, the velcro quality fades and then it has trouble staying on throughout the night.I bought this sleep mask a couple of months ago and now it slides around, falls off or Ill find it around my neck. OH, and it absorbs and retains the moisture from your face. You will see it in the sleep mask after a week or so. I will admit, its very very soft and allows zero light in."
'2'.'0',"Thin material, light bleeds through. Velcro is weak","I absolutely loved this product at first. It is very soft and does a true blackout job. But after a few months of maybe twice/week use, the stitching is coming undone in the nose area and the velcro doesnt hold well, even with a toothbrush cleaning. The velco just seems a little too smooth for something you really want to hold onto your face as you toss and turn. Loved it but wished it lasted longer for the price."
'2'.'0',"I was excited about the mask because its much wider and covers your ears, and it is indeed soft. But, it isnt thick enough to keep light out in the morning (the whole point of a sleep mask), and the velcro is already losing strength a few weeks in. I would not buy it again",Has helped me a lot with getting more sleep. All others have fallen off. Velcro stopped working and no it's pretty useless. I wished it would had lasted longer because it was very helpful for a bit.
'2'.'0',"I was excited about this eye mask based on the reviews. It was was very soft, however, the chemical smell in the material or from the warehouse was a deal breaker for me and did not abate even with time. It just stank and I couldnt stomach putting something like that on my face every night.",Loved this mask until it ripped in less than 3 months of using.
'2'.'0',Good if you have a giant head,"First, the positives: The mask is VERY comfortable. Its by far the most comfortable sleep mask Ive tried. Incredibly soft, fits well on the face, it primes me for sleep.And thats about it for the positives. The negatives? Lets get started. Disclaimer- I do not typically write reviews. Seriously, look and see for yourself. The fact that Im spending effort to write this speaks volumes to how disappointed I am with this product.1.) The mask lets in light. Its advertised as blackout- its absolutely not. Even with faint light in the room, I can clearly see it through the mask. Granted, if youre in a room thats already dark, you wont notice, but if youre trying to sleep during the day, you will absolutely see noticeable light through the mask. Does it reduce the amount you see significantly? Yes. Is it black out, NO.2.) The velcro wears out in about a month. This is the SECOND one of these Ive had from this company. I thought the first one may have been a fluke. Its not! This product WILL NOT LAST. The velcro is cheap and horribly made, and when it stops working, it renders the mask utterly useless, as it cannot be worn without the velcro keeping it wrapped around your head. Horrible design.The many many positive reviews you have seen are likely from people who have been using their mask for a very short time. Check out the ""all reviews"" section and read the ones with low ratings. We are all saying the exact same thing - the velcro does not work. If you want to spend $25 bucks on something that will work for a month, go nuts. If youre looking for a great mask that is both comfortable and will actually last, look elsewhere."
'2'.'0',I have a huge head but even for me this is too large. I have to pull the right velcro piece way past the left one or else if I connect the velcro pieces its way too loose. So the velcro is just sticking loosely to the cotton and comes off really easily,"I have been using this eye mask for about a month now and have some issues with it. The height of it is unnecessarily high and the cut-in for your nose is not deep enough. Because of this, the mask rides up my head through the night, causing me to keep readjusting it through the night. If I dont, light seeps in through the bottom. It would be so much better if it was about 2"" shorter, with a deeper notch for your nose."
'2'.'0',"This mask is huge.  Typically you want a sleep mask to be rather minimal.  I didn't like this mask at all.  It was bulky and made me sweat.  It didn't stay on my head at all.  While it was on, it did block the light well, so if you don't move around much in bed and don't mind the warmth it might be a good fit for you.",It's very soft and nice but just super bulky.
'2'.'0',Mask comes off when you turn your head,"Good quality and super soft and fluffy but it just wouldn't stay on at the tightness I have it. It needs to be fairly secured for it to stick and the tightness is just as disturbing to my sleep as light, it's not tight but I need to feel almost nothing on my face to be able to sleep and based on the reviews I thought this mask was it, but sadly it wasn't. If you need to feel next to no compression on your face like me this mask probably isn't it. Maybe if you have no hair,  thin hair or have a smaller head it would give you that delicate abyss of blackness you need. Edibles and black out curtains is the only things that works!"
'2'.'0',Perfect until 1st wash,Velcro stopped working after a few weeks. Now there is no way to get this to stay on! Look elsewhere!
'2'.'0',Worked well until Velcro wore out,"Ive used smaller sleep masks that have better seal against light infiltration. Tested this mask for several nights with different tightness. Although this mask is larger, it provides a worse seal against light than smaller ones, and even worse it presses against the eyes and can cover rmthe nose and be harder to breath."
'2'.'0',"Thin material, light bleeds through. Velcro is weak",Loved this mask. Within three months of regular use the velcro has completley failed and the mask is now unusable. I will buy another mask of similar style elsewhere.

Even if you pay for the upgraded velcro, it fails within a couple months. This is my second purchase and I will, unfortunately, not purchase again due to this."
'2'.'0',Good if you have a giant head,"Although when you first put this on it feel really comfortable, while sleeping it is very difficult to have this stay in place.  I dont know what the issue is.  Maybe because it is so freaking huge, but there is no head grip.  Every single night, at least 3-4 times, I wake up to find this laying somewhere else on the bed than where my head is found.  I would love to return this, but since its something that has been worn, I will eat the loss, so that no one has to handle my skin cells.  I bought another sleep mask, but will keep this for travel.  I think it would work well for airline travel, but laying down with it is useless."

Although I dont really know whats in or on the fabric, I react to it. I do not have sensitive skin. I do not recommend this product as I dont think they are being honest  about the materials and/ or chemicals being used. The actual construction of the eye mask is great but something is shady"
'2'.'0',"Just Wait, Sleep Mask Quickly Degrades",Was Great Product - For a Month
'2'.'0',Soft and breathable...but subpar stitching and velcro,Wonderful at first but doesn't last
'2'.'0',"Velcro didn't last long, Dissatisfied because it  was otherwise great.",Velcro attachment weakens with washing
'2'.'0',READ before buying! This mask will NOT last,Like everyone said this mask works. Light is blocked. The mask is soft. Sleeping was easy. Now a month later the Velcro won't stick any more or barely sticks. No idea why. The mask won't work if it can't stay on your head.Really good when it works. Hope they get better Velcro in the future.
'2'.'0',Velcro,"This is a good face mask for short-term use. The outer layer of cotton is very thin and rips easily and the stitches come loose very easily to reveal a synthetic inner foam which separates easily into strands. This is NOT a durable product and starts getting flimsy after a couple of hand washes. It also stretches out, so the black straps after many uses dont meet each other at their original location. This mask doesnt last longer than a year, even if you hand stitch the separating pieces back together. For this price, I would expect much better quality, couple of rows of sturdy stitches, and 100% cotton, since polyester loses its qualities over time."
'2'.'0',Very soft and comfortable but the Velcro does not hold. I have had it less than a month. Disappointed.,"This sleep mask is very comfortable, even keeps your head warm on colds nights. However I have only had it 6 months and it has already begun deteriorating. The fabric, while very soft, has begun to tear and frey in seemingly random spots."
'2'.'0',"Underwhelming, might update","This doesnt actually block light well. Its really comfortable. It stayed on pretty well compared to other masks that Ive worn. However, Ive never had any mask that lets so much light in. It definitely keeps things darker, and if the light is minimal it does a good job of blocking it all and not leaking. However, if you have full light such as a bedroom light on or bright sun in the window, you will get a face full of light. I wanted to love this, but it is not a good mask."
'2'.'0',"Velcro stopped working, dont buy!",The material is soft as advertised but the cloth presses against eyeballs causing uncomfortable to wear. If you have long eyelashes its definitely an abysmal sleep mask.
'2'.'0',"Not very effective, presses against eyes.",The bulky velcro strap makes it difficult to wear comfortably!
'2'.'0',Wonderful mask. Velcro failed in 3 months.,Velcro stops working after a couple months
'2'.'0',Still use but it's only ok,I use this for sleeping because I don't sleep! But this is not as comfortable as it looks! It hurts my ears.
'2'.'0',"Love,  but DOES NOT LAST",Change color if you sweat.
'2'.'0',Comes off during sleep,"This mask does not provide 100% blackout. So its about as useful as tying a bandana over your eyes.Its soft, thats kinda nice."
'2'.'0',"I do not like this sleep mask. It didnt stay on my head, I woke up with my dog playing with it on the floor. The material is very light and doesnt block out the light. I would not recommend to anybody. Save your money and buy something different.",This mask will change the way your head lays on the pillow and will prop it up just a little bit. It annoys me and makes my neck hurt in the morning. It is too big.I dont like my ears against my head and it pushes your ears.  The fact that your entire face doesnt lay against the pillow and theres a slight bump can annoy you. Seems insignificant but it makes me not use this at all
'2'.'0',"I am a side sleeper, but found that this mask would rotate around my head too easily, so I would wake up and have to adjust it. If you try to tighten it, it can feel like a vise around your head. It is very soft, but looks silly.",The nose on this was made poorly. The cut/sewing of the part tucked in is lopsided so one side is noticeably higher than the other. I have to look for an alternative product.
'2'.'0',"I really loved this product at first and even bought another one as a gift. However, a couple of months later the velcro doesnt stick anymore. Really bummed b/c the mask was really comfortable, but now its pretty much useless. Im not sure if its just poor quality or doesnt hold up well to machine washing.","I really liked this sleep mask. I would give 5 stars but after using it for about a week the product has began to fall apart at the seems. So poor quality, I guess. From the price point I thought it would not have had this issue. Guess I'll have to find another brand."
'2'.'0',"Used other masks that just bled on my pillow cases that I cant replace, some were my grandmothers. Anyway this has no smell and is a very soft covering blocking most of the light. This has not bled on my pillow cases but its too large and not just for me but anyone unless you want that. An update is I chose to get rid of this as I washed it but it didnt wash well at all.","First of all, you can get the same sleep mask for about ONE THIRD THE PRICE from another Amazon seller!  Keep looking!  And while is was fine during winter months, it COVERS TOO MUCH of the face to be comfortable during warmer months.  Could stand to lose an inch to an inch and a half from the upper portion.Good points are as follows:  It (and similar masks from other sellers at lesser cost) is softer than other sleep masks.  It (and similar masks from other sellers at lesser cost) is suitable for sidesleepers like me because it doesnt press uncomfortably on the side of the nose.To recap:  If this seller reduced his price down to that of at least one other Amazon seller (under 10 bucks), and lopped about an inch and a half from the upper portion, I would give this mask 5 stars, and recommend it highly, especially for sidesleepers."
'2'.'0',"After unpacking the mask, I noticed a small red stain on it.  I'm not sure if it's a blood stain but it sure does look & feel like it.  Needless to say, I am grossed out and will be returning it ASAP.If not for the stain, I would have rated this mask four stars.  I did not try it on (for obvious reasons) but it is very soft.  However, I do not think it will block out light as well as masks I have used in the past.",I like the size but it heats up to quick very sweaty
'2'.'0',"Liked it at first, but after 4 months the velcrow stopped working. Theres just only so many times you can wear before it loses stickiness. Would not buy again.","Its okay.. but if youre trying to sleep during the daytime, this isnt that helpful. It does work fairly well at night, but it wasnt that comfortable to me and found myself not wearing it after a couple weeks of receiving it in the mail. Id pass on this one. Its not necessarily bad, but its not that great either. And I do think its overpriced for just a strip of cloth over your face. This is be a $9.99 product honestly. At best thats how much this thing is worth."
'2'.'0',"This was the best sleep mask that Ive ever worn and I slept very well while wearing it.  Unfortunately, after one month of normal usage the velcro started failing and it would come off anytime I moved.  About 10 days after that the velcro was useless and I could no longer stick the straps together.  I cant recommend a product that only lasts for a month, but If that design flaw could be fixed it would be a great product.",Not what I was expecting.
'2'.'0',"I bought this mask and loved it so much that I bought two more, one for my husband and another for a friend. At first it feels amazing, very comfortable and a joy to wear. The material feels really good against your face. But this is not going to be an item that lasts a long time. Within a couple of weeks it no longer had that same comfortable feeling and some months later it doesn't even stay on bc it has very poorly designed velcro. Save your money for something better and more long","Doesnt block light around nose, smells strongly for a full week"
'2'.'0',"Waited to review this. Its soft and feels good when wearing it, however after a few washes the velcro is no longer working to keep it on my head. Please fix this with better velcro.",Velcro strip on the mask does not last!
'2'.'0',Velcro goes bad in a month,"Unless youve got a head the size of a watermelon, youll have a hard time getting it to stay in place. Ive got a normal, adult man sized head, and this thing barely stays on. Theres not enough Velcro on the back, so I only get an inch or two to secure it. It blocks light, but thats about it. All in all, better than nothing, but Id get something else."
'2'.'0',Comfortable but not durable,"I was excited to try this Handmade Cotton Sleep Mask for its upgraded design and light-blocking features. However, my experience has been less than satisfactory. The Velcro on the back of the mask is of poor quality and the stitching tends to rip off when I try to remove it. Although the fitting is decent, the overall comfort of the mask is subpar."
'2'.'0',"Although it states its 100% cotton material, it is hot and uncomfortable.","Velcro didnt last long and wouldnt keep itself together for more then a month,  not a good option for sleepers who move even a little as it will come undone or off with very little movement."
'2'.'0',"Great comfort, I would highly recommend if you do not sweat.",It was comfortable but does not block the light completely
'2'.'0',This mask started off well but the velcro failed after a couple of washes. Had to throw the mask away.,"Soft material, but let's light through. Covers too much of your face for normal sleeping, which I found very uncomfortable."
'2'.'0',This didn't last very long. At first it worked great. After about a month the padding inside started to shift and you can see daylight through it. The mask would always seem to ride up while sleeping and it absorbed all the facial oils and made it look disgusting. The Velcro also didn't seem to hold very well. If you have an issue staying asleep when it is bright I would look at a different mask. Very disappointed in this one.,This is not sound proof by any stretch. Iy comes with 2 little earbuds you can stick in your ears and then you can have some quiet. The material is soft and very floppy. It does stay on your head .. I guess it has that going for it.
'2'.'0',Disappointing construction,As soon as I received this I realized it wasnt going to last - the velcro is really cheap/poor quality and barely holds it together. Shame because its comfortable otherwise but I ended up going back to a sleep mask with a more traditional elastic band.
'2'.'0',Falling apart at 1 week of use,"It's super soft and comfortable, but doesn't do it's job! This is not blackout whatsoever, I can still see light through this eye mask. Completely defeats the purpose and I get terrible sleep with this. Plus I think this mask gives me acne (probably because I had to consistently tug it down during the night to keep it covering my eyes.)I actually had to revert to my old crappy eye mask that's hanging on by a thread because of how bad my sleep was with this one."
'2'.'0',Good Points and BAD points,Great Sleep but wears after 3 months! Beware
'2'.'0',"The Velcro stopped working after a few months so I could only lay the mask across my face, which didn't work at shielding my eyes from the light. Definitely not worth it for the price. You would think for how much this cost they would have used a higher quality Velcro??","Soft, but design doesnt work well"
'2'.'0',Mask was way too big on the head and still let light in at the nose holes.,"Comfortable, not durable."
'2'.'0',Fabric nice. But was heavy on my eyes.,Ripped After 2 Months
'2'.'0',"Envisioned this heavier than it is, very flimsy and doesn't stay put. Velcro loses holding ability thru the night and I'm primarily on my back or side.",Great while it lasted
'2'.'0',"I had a similar one prior and it was much better, was shorter and blocked all the light, including around the nose. This one is too big, smells like very strong perfume, and does not block the light which is the point of this.","Had high hopes for this but over time, like within months , the velcro at back stopped securing. They need to upgrade the fastening velcro and make the material softer and washable. Not durable.  Replacing mine and looking elsewhere"
'2'.'0',The material on this mask was very nice. But the velcro strip did not last only a short while then it was good for nothing. Very disappointed.,I couldn't wear it because it's too big.  It covers too much of my face and it was too hot and the Velcro stuck my hair and I had to cut my hair out.  Unusable for me.
'2'.'0',"Disappointing Velcro Quality, Comfort Compromised",This mask gets really hot at night. It would be good for winter weather but no way I am able to use this in the summer. I would recommend changing the material this is made out of into some kind of cooling material.
'2'.'0',"Scratchy on back, not very durable.","I bought this in hopes it would work well with my CPAP mask. It works fairly well, but really no better than a $6 mask. There still is just as much light bleed through the CPAP itself, no matter how I line up the eye pads.Unfortunately, it has recently started to have an uncomfortable issue on the back. The strap has thinned to the point where the Velcro attaches that it leaves a wide swath to stab into the back of my neck, and I cant get it to fully cover no matter what I do.Its also getting worn out to the point that Im worried it wont even last another six months. It just seems that something this expensive should last significantly longer, and be much higher quality."
'2'.'0',Did not work with full face CPAP mask,Couldn't position correctly over my headgear for my breathing machine. Also didn't like that I was strapped in with some many different straps. From the machine and from this thing . Maybe consider a strapless design.
'2'.'0',Totally disappointed in this product. None of the claims they make were true for me:1. NOT snag,"I like the adjustment feature but better materials should have been used, considering the cost of mask. The cotton eye pieces irritate the skin and hold heat to the point of sweating. The Velcro band is a little too thick making it awkward and uncomfortable to move around. These are good for total black out and little else. Save your money."
'2'.'0',Simply too large and uncomfortable to sleep with,"Well made, but where the velcro meshes together is simply far too thick and made it too uncomfortable for me to sleep with. I think there was a brand logo where the straps meet that is WAY too thick and makes sleeping with this really uncomfortable. I felt like there was a big bump underneath my head when I would lay down. Im someone that gets hyperfocused on different things when I sleep so if theres anything bothering me/stimulating me I wont be able to sleep (hence why I was buying the mask in the first place, even small amounts of light make it difficult for me to sleep) Its a shame, as the rest of the mask is really soft and clearly well put together. Had to wind up returning it as I couldnt use it."
'2'.'0',Not good for side sleepers,"I bought this based on the glowing recommendations on the site. However, upon using it, I noticed that its really not a good product for side sleepers.The mask fits perfectly when youre on your back, however, when you turn on your side, your pillow will push on the mask, thus creating gap that allows light in. It also creates extra pressure, as the pillow would push on the side of the cup and you would feel the cup pressed against your face on one side.Lastly, due to the way it fits, I have yet to have the mask stay on the entire night. Ive been using it for multiple nights now, and without fail Ive woken up without the mask every time. Whereas, for other lower profile masks, they would always stay on.So, if youre a back sleeper Id recommend it, but otherwise, Id find something else."
'2'.'0',Difficult to sleep on your side or stomach with this on. The eye,Didn't like them way too bulky
'2'.'0',"I bought this and the MZOO sleep mask. Tbe only way to block all the light was to have it on very tight. I couldn't do it but it was a little tight, my eyes hurt, I slept terribly. The MZOO sleep mask worked much better. I'm not using this one again. It was expensive so it's unfortunate!",works and then it dont
'2'.'0',wont stay on my eyes  moves around way to much  and the eye cups leak in light...sucks for the price you would think someone  made something that works,?
'2'.'0',Gimmicky and not for side sleepers,"I had high hopes for this mask, but it does not live up to the hype.I am primarily a side sleeper, take a long time to wind down, and am prone to overheating, so I end up flipping back and forth between my side and back and adjusting the covers a lot when trying to fall asleep. That doesn't bode well for anything  on my head, whether it be a scrunchie, a hat in colder weather, or a sleep mask.This mask, in spite of its hype, has been a completely disappointing waste of money and time spent trying to make it work for me.First off, it's unbelievably difficult to adjust the eye cups to the right positions. You just have to guess and keep guessing. You have to have the mask off of your face to move the eye cups. I tried about 30 different times to get the eye cups in the right places and at the right angles under the mask. I finally found one position that sort of works, but......secondly, there's a ton of light leakage, even if the cups are pretty much in the right place! Just like other reviewers have said, the only way to have no light (especially around the bridge of the nose) is to strap the mask on so tightly that it causes undue pressure around the eyes, bordering on creating a headache. The only other option is to have an already-darkened room ' in which case, why would you need a sleep mask? If, like me, you move around a lot when you sleep, the thing's going to shift right off your head, too, no matter what, which is disruptive.Adjusting the strap to fit your head is also a nightmare. It's either going to be too tight or too loose almost any way you try to make it fit. There are small pieces of elastic toward the back, but they are stiff enough that don't help. If I place the strap so it doesn't smoosh the tops of my ears, then the eye cups are almost too low for the strap to help them block light. Maybe I just have a weird eye/ear-height relationship?I thought the eye cups would be the selling feature of this mask, but they are not ' they are hot. Really hot. After about ten minutes, it feels like I have put heating pads around my eyes. The cups become little dark greenhouses in which potato sprouts could flourish. There is no cooling air flow (except maybe where light leaks in). The cups are a just-hard-enough foam that they do not mold well to the actual contours of my face, and the fabric covers on them are completely non-absorbent.I've looked for the cooling eye cups, but I can't find them here on Amazon. They would probably be a gel plastic and not absorptive at all, anyway, which would offer a whole host of other problems.I imagine that if you're traveling on a train, an airplane, or as a passenger in a car and you wanted to cut yourself off from some (but not all) light and noise, you could use these with some noise canceling headphones and get by. For actual sleep, restorative sleep, sleep that gets you through the night, this mask doesn't do it for me.Very occasionally I can get in about a half hour of napping during the day with minimal discomfort before some problem with the mask wakes me up again. Sometimes, a half hour nap is all I need to return to my day. So, that is the only thing I can use this mask for now. I can't rely upon it at night for any help. It's way too uncomfortable and difficult to manage, to the point of repeated disruption.I would do better with a plain bandanna tied around my eyes, honestly."
'2'.'0',Unbearable eye pressure,"I like the attempt. The materials are superb. Incredibly soft and amazing feeling to the touch. However, the execution is lacking. By design, this product is essentially like wearing swim googles to bed, but with pillows instead of gaskets around the eyes. The natural uncomfortable question arises, do I put the straps over the ears or behind. Both suck. Either your ears are scrapped by velcro or compressed by the band. Both making sleep hard. The second major flaw is either the band falls off your head immediately because it is too loose or the ""eyecup"" things that are the selling point put the entire gripping force around your eye sockets, once again, making sleep difficult. Thereby defeating the entire purpose of the product. Thirdly, the structural integrity of the eye socket compressing grip falls apart when you sleep on your side, once again, making them difficult to sleep in if youre a side sleeper. Overall I feel really bad giving them a bad review. It is clear that massive effort and thought was put into the design, material selection, and attempt, but overall falls massively shorter from what you can get for less than 10 dollars from generic Chinese shipper number 1,523 on this site. Definitely avoid this product, but would try a new design in a heartbeat from this company if steps are made to improve this concept!"
'2'.'0',This Mask Worsened My Sleep Quality,"I bought this mask because of its promise that it provides 100% blackout while also maintaining zero pressure on and around the eyes. The material that the mask itself is made out of is very soft and plush, especially on the interior. The material that the detachable eye-cups are made of seems to be memory foam (although I couldnt find any confirmation of this on the official store website, or anywhere). The attachable parts of the mask were made of a material akin to Velcro, except it was more discrete, and didnt tug on any loose hair.On the first few nights that I tried this mask on, I realized that the only way to truly get the ""blackout effect"" that was heavily marketed was to have the mask, and the eye-cups, placed firmly around your face. Over a couple minutes of wearing the mask, it caused mild discomfort that gradually increased throughout the night until I took it off. Initially, I brushed this off as needing the memory foam to soften to my facial structures. Within the next week and a half, I saw no difference in the discomfort that I was experiencing with this mask. The last night that I slept with the mask on, I woke up to what felt like a sinus headache. Again, it was because of the pressure that the mask placed on my sinuses. That night, I switched back to my 5 year old silk sleep mask, and got much better rest than I have got within the past week and a half with trialing this mask.Overall, I was disappointed with the results that this mask gave me (It actually worsened my sleep quality within the trial period I used it). The promise that it ostensibly provided zero pressure on the eye is borderline false advertisement. The best thing about this product was the quality material that the mask itself was made of, and the generous return policy."
'2'.'0',"Flawed, not ideal for side sleepers; sent it back","Theoretically, this mask seemed perfect after looking at the photos.  But once it arrived and I tried it for two nights,  its flaws and high price point had me send it back.  Im happy with a less fussy and less expensive mask which Ill mention at the end of this review.The thick walls of the eyecups were not necessarily a dealbreaker for me as a side sleeper.  They WERE uncomfortable on whichever side of the face was against the pillow, but that may not be a problem for you, even if youre a side sleeper, depending on how soft or firm your pillow is.  What is irritating is that when I came to write this review, I noticed that the product page claims THIS product is perfect for side sleepers'but then I also saw they peddle a ""slim"" version that is specifically targeted for side sleepers.The adjustable eyecups were a big selling point for me.  I thought they made sense, allowing for a customized fit.  But in reality, once you pull them off of the mask base, trying to achieve symmetry or gauge whether youre putting them back in the same place makes them more of a liability than a benefit.  If the mask base had some markings on it, it would make tweaking the positioning of the eyecups so much easier.  I wasnt able to successfully adjust the eyecups to stop light from coming in near the inner edges of my eyebrows.  The only way I could achieve blackout was to make the fit tighter than was comfortable.The band itself isnt uncomfortable, but I had forgotten that its a pain to adjust the band on masks like these (its been a couple of years since Ive worn a sleep mask) where the band is two separate straps that join by overlapping.  Similar to the eyecups, trying to guess whether youve reattached the velcro straps to make them tighter or looser is a pain.  If the straps had markings so that you could see aim at a specific level of overlap, it would be an improvement.Ultimately, I went with one of the Unimi ""2021 Upgraded"" sleep mask here on Amazon.  Unimi has several generations of masks available; I tried the third generation and its a keeper.  No eyecups to move around, 100% blackout, and a closed-loop band that can be adjusted by sliding the plastic piece left or right with one hand make it almost perfect for me.  The cushioning is a bit thick for a side sleeper, but I dont want to try their thinner version for side sleepers because Im afraid I wont get complete blackout.  The product page for this one is here: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QRC4C5Q or you can search for it in the Amazon searchbox with product code: B08QRC4C5Q"
'2'.'0',Like Sleeping With Swim Goggles On,"This mask is one of those things that is probably better in theory than in practice. Its designed to function well, but once you actually put it on you see why it doesnt work.It took me quite a while to get the eye cups adjusted in a way to achieve as near to ""100% blackout"" as I could. Even after about 20 minutes of adjustments I couldnt achieve 100% darkness. Light leaks in through the front of the band and then through the sides of the eye cups. It also leaks in through the bottom of the eye cups. The only way to achieve nearly 100% (but still not 100%) darkness was to tighten the mask until it was uncomfortable. Id say this mask blocks maybe 5-10% more light than any standard sleep mask with a nose flap.The eye cups are intended to take pressure off of your eyes, but I dont find that a regular mask applies an uncomfortable amount of pressure to my eyes to begin with. They advertise the cups allowing you to blink, but who is blinking when theyre sleeping? My eyes are staying closed.The problem with the cups is that they dont eliminate the pressure, they just shift it to the area around your eye. With the mask on tight enough, so it stays put and doesnt leak any light, youve now got two giant cups around your eyes pressing down on the area around them. It gets even worse if youre a side sleeper; youre not going to avoid partially resting your head on one of the cups against the pillow and thats when the mask really starts to become unusable. Its like youre sleeping on a knot in a rope pressed up against your cheek and eye socket. Totally uncomfortable.All of these downsides and discomfort from wearing the mask makes the marginal increase in darkness compared to a regular mask not worth it. Any light leaking in is annoying, and slightly less light leaking in, while also having an uncomfortable mask on, is not better.I forced myself to use the mask for a few nights to see if it just took a bit to get used to, but after a few nights I always found myself reaching for my existing, cheap (way cheaper than this one), normal sleep mask over the Manta every time. Theres nothing about this mask that works for me. Maybe itll work for you if youve never used a regular mask and have nothing to compare it to, and sleep on your back, but other than that, just stick with the $5 one you already have.This mask seems like its made well, and the fabric is a nice material. I wouldnt mind seeing this company attempt to make a standard mask with this quality (and at a more reasonable price), but this concept for a mask is a bust.Hopefully the ""100%"" in their ""100% Satisfaction"" claim is closer to 100% than the ""100%"" in their ""100% Blackout"" claim."
'2'.'0',Not reccomended for side sleepers,"So I bought this at the end of 2022. Its a great sleep mask for what it is, but as a side sleeper it would put a little pressure on my right eye. I got used to it and didnt think much of it, until I went in for my annual eye exam, and found that I had signifgantly worse vision in my left eye. I am fairly healthy and in my mid 20s -- I have never had less than 20/20 vision. My doctor was puzzled as to the source of this issue, until I mentioned the sleep maskApparently sleeping with an eye mask like this can put pressure on your eyes(sort of like the way pressing on them will cause blurriness for a few minutes), causing the vision lose. I now need glassses. My doc suspects that without the mask my vision should return to normal in a few months.Writing this to let people know about this issue. Not worth damaging your eye site"
'2'.'0',I wanted to love it. It feels like such high quality... but its not comfortable at all. I tried several different kinds and was sure this would be the best. Its just too tight. I could maybe take a 15 minute nap.. but I cannot wear it to bed. Went with a cheaper softer option that did about as well at blocking light.,"Side sleeper, Small face - doesnt work for me"
'2'.'0',I am an adult woman with a small,"Ive known about this brand for awhile but always avoided purchasing a sleep mask from them due to the high price. I ended up ordering this mask because I was in desperate need of a sleep mask and I figured why the heck not. Well, let me tell you why the heck not- its super uncomfortable. The eye cups seem like they are soft enough to accomodate a side-sleeper but the reality is that after wearing this mask for even a few hours you will have a headache (unless you sleep exclusively on your back). For me, this was a huge waste of money."
'2'.'0',Quality Just Isnt There,"Im a back sleeper so comfort wise this mask was not a problem at all and it did indeed block 100% of ambient light. My biggest issue with the mask is the overall quality. Despite claiming to use high quality materials, after only a few months both the velcro and elastic have worn out considerably. The elastic bands on both sides of the mask are all crinkled up and you see bits and pieces of elastic sticking out. Also, the velcro barely sticks anymore, it seems as if the material its supposed to stick to has worn out and is all fuzzy now so the velcro cant get a good grip on it. It barely sticks now and often when Im first settling into bed it comes loose and I have to re-attach. This is all despite following the exact instructions for washing and having a skinny head, so its not like any of these components are under considerable stress. For this price point, I expected a lot better."
'2'.'0',,
'5'.'0',"I take it off halfway through the night, but I am falling asleep sooner with it than without it.","Some people may think it ""sleeps hot"", although that isnt bothering me. It feels kooky at first because there are these pronounced foam rings around the eyes inside which hold the mask away from the lashes and eyelids. These rings really do work for that. No pressure on my eyes, and I can open my eyes all the way without feeling the mask. The mask fastens with a Velcro-type closure in back, and I dont like mashing my hair down with it, so I put it under my hair; it tends to slip a little. But that is okay since I end up on my side and I have to adjust my mask a bit for that. Some people may not care for that; it is the thickness of the mask that requires me to move the mask around when on my side. The best thing: I didnt know how much I was bothered by light coming in around my window, but with the mask I am falling asleep almost immediately. It is becoming a bit of a bedtime ritual. I put on the mask, and ""lights out"", literally and figuratively! (June 2023: I am editing this to update.) The other night, I woke to visit the bathroom, and wondered at there being no light at all in the room as I walked to the door, eyes wide open. Until I realized I was still wearing the mask! That is how comfortable I, the ""Princess And The Pea"", am finding the mask, despite my misgivings at the beginning. I didnt even know I still had it on."
'5'.'0',This is so comfortable!!!!,Comfort and zero light
'5'.'0',"Started working graveyard shift and tried multiple sleep masks before this one and all of them were pretty uncomfortable and light would shine through the bottom. This mask has been perfect. It's comfortable to wear at night and and doesn't let any light through. You can also adjust the eye pads to fit your face better. I wish I would have started with this mask from the beginning, instead of trying other products before this one.","I had a friend recommend this mask to me, they were right. I was a little skeptical of the product at first due to their heavy focus on marketing and advertisement, but the quality of the sleep mask is there to back it up. Its comfortable and does a great job at keeping out light."
'5'.'0',"I love this sleep mask. I work nights and have to sleep during the day. I've used other masks, but they're usually a little too tight for comfort if they are going to stay on. The manta is very comfortable and does a fantastic job of blocking out all the light in the room.",Great fit to protect eyes
'5'.'0',"worth the additional cost to get such a quality mask. I like the holes for the eyes, and as a side sleeper, I always feel that masks get pressed too hard against my face and eyes. This one fits well, as tight as one sets it, and will protect the eyes so you dont squosh them while sleeping on your side.",This is a great mask. I got it to wear with my CPAP because it is so adjustable. I am a side sleeper and it works great. I recommend!
'5'.'0',I havent had this kind of sleep in years. Im shocked.,"Over the course of time Ive tried numerous sleep masks. The worst (most) bled black onto my pillowcases. How can you manufacture a black mask with dye that runs? They all had gaps around the nose that let the light in. Many had band features that rub that delicate spot just over ones ears. These? These are great in every way. They dont bleed. At all. The cups completely block the light. Completely.  I am a side sleeper, and even though the cups have a bit bulk, they are soft, and tapered towards the temple; I can sleep on them with the side of my face smooshed into the pillow.  The velcro band has the perfect amount of elasticity and adjusts snuggly. The eye cups are adjustable for width and facial structure as well. Im really happy I found these. Im a quintessential princess and the pea type sleeper, easily disturbed, and I find these comfortable and comforting, and while this sounds like an ad, Im volunteering this with nothing in return. Im just grateful for all the thoughtful features and going out of my way to say."
'5'.'0',"These eye shades are soft, snug fitting or loose fitting, (depending on your preference) light weight, light proof, comfortable all night long, and they stay put no matter how much you may toss and turn in your sleep. The eyecups allow you to blink without interference, but fit comfortably around your cheek and brow ridge to keep out all light. The removable eye cups are also easily adjustable to fit any eye spacing for large or small heads. I have machine washed and dried mine and it holds up beautifully in the washing machine. I would highly recommend these eye shades to anyone like myself who lives in a heavily light polluted area like Los Angeles, California where it never gets dark. Now if I can just solve the problem of cancelling out the sound of traffic and helicopters throughout the night.",Game changer for sleep

I gave these a try and loved them right away. They are lightweight, soft, comfortable, and do a fabulous job blocking out all light.They are constructed with a pillow",Best Sleep Mask Ever Guaranteed!
'5'.'0',"Ive purchased an insane amount of sleep masks from Amazon, and after trying out (and disliking) numerous ones, I can confidently say that this is the best one Ive come across! Its not only supremely comfortable and soft, but it also effectively blocks out all light and can be adjusted to fit various face shapes and sizes. Yes, its a little pricey compared to others but if youre in search of the perfect sleep mask, look no further. This one wont let you down!",Soft and does what is advertised
'5'.'0',Worth it if you don't like making your room super dark.,"It feels weird and uncomfortable the first night but once you get used to it, it's fantastic at blocking light."
'5'.'0',Excellent?? if you don't roll over,"If you're on a plane, in a car, train & are in a seated position where you can't roll over, you won't find anything better than this. I love that I can wear these and blink my eyes with fast strobe light speeds and not once have my eyelashes touch. When I sleep I absolutely hate any pressure on my eyes so I absolutely love these."

Normal sleep masks do not prevent moisture evaporation but this sleep mask has little 'chambers' for your eyes and it's a very comfortable mask to sleep with. I strongly recommend.
'5'.'0',Best eye mask on the market,"Great eye mask. Trust me, buy this one before buying others! I wish I had before purchasing 3 other cheaper ones that did not meet my expectations! This one is comfortable for my eyes and 100% takes out the light"

My only dislike is the mild pressure I feel on the back of my ears where the strap rests around my head.,"Ive owned hundreds of sleep mask over the years. This is the best, by far. There is a learning curve on getting the adjustment right but after you do, you wont think about buying another brand sleep mask again."
'5'.'0',Great if I didn't take it off in my sleep ????????,This mask is incredible and I love it but for some reason with this one I always take it off in my sleep and sometimes the feeling of it being so close to my nose feels like I can't breathe even though I can. I tried spreading the eye covers farther apart but it hasn't seemed to work I had a super cheap that I didn't take off but I'm going to keepTrying lol

'5'.'0',Best Sleep Ive had in forever,"I borrow one of these from my friend before I ordered so I knew what I was getting before I got it, but I have to say that these sleep masks are a godsend. No light gets through and comfy to sleep in too. If you work the night shift or need to sleep during the day for whatever reason I would highly recommend!"
'5'.'0',You get what you pay for!,"Im used to wearing the little sleep masks that are normally four or five masks for less than $10 on a lightening deal. While comfortable they dont stay in place, dont fully block light & get in the way of my P30i CPAP frame with nasal pillows mask. The slim manta is perfect in so many ways. First, it is slim enough that it does not touch my CPAP.  It is light weight & very comfortable - after the first couple of nights of getting used to it feeling different on my face than my previous sleep masks. It seems cooler because not so much of my face is covered. I sleep on my back or side & it functions properly in both positions. It truly is 100% blackout. If a person is still getting light leakage then its not adjusted properly for their face. It doesnt have to be too tight to block the light either. If the cups are in the right place all it needs is gentle pressure from the strap to keep them there. Finally, I have a severe natural rubber latex allergy and tried this mask based on the comments from others with the same allergy after reading reviews on all of the manta masks, and I also have zero reaction to the mask."
'5'.'0',One night in?? how did I live without this?,"Okay, so granted I've only used it once, but I slept like a rock. Even at night I'm pretty sensitive to light. A hall light comes on, my wife looking at her phone, etc.I slept all night and didn't move at all. That never happens.Also, I use a CPAP with a Dreamwear mask, which is essentially a big loop that goes under the nose and over the top of the head. The whole thing is a passageway for air. I was concerned that this might either restrict airflow or cause noise from the air coming out. I'm very happy to report that neither of these was an issue. If anything, it helps hold the CPAP mask in place even better.The quality of this mask is excellent. It's extremely soft and comfortable, and once adjusted properly, truly blocks out 100% of the light. I can turn on and off the lamp right next to my head and honestly can't tell if it's on or not. Highly recommended!"

'3'.'0',"The bands on the side are very thick which makes sleeping on your side a bit uncomfortable.

I'd have to use the weight of my arm to get the pillow juuust right and not get pushed up or around. A cheaper mask with more shallow cups is better for me, and I'll stick with those.

'3'.'0',"This is a great mask if you sleep on your back or are on a plane. But if you're like me and sleep on you your side, half in a pillow, there is pressure around your eyes and behind your ears with the strap (just from being bulky and your ear pressing against it) But it definitely blocks out all light! I just wish it didn't create pressure points around my eyes and behind my ears when I sleep on my side.",Not for side sleepers!
'3'.'0',"This is a soft and comfortable mask that pockets the eyes and is great for back sleepers. Once I turned even slightly onto my side, the eye ""pockets"" get pushed into the eyeballs and are very uncomfortable!","it is lightweight, but a lot of material...."
'4'.'0',Was expecting a little more,"As someone who has never used sleep masks, I wanted this product for the 16 hour flight to Japan. The quality was great and it never came off my head, but I was expecting a little more comfort given the price point I end up returning the product but I'm sure for people who are dependent on sleep, masks for rest, this would be a more than sufficient product. As long as you can make it past the high price point."
'4'.'0',Very high quality and great service. It just didnt fit my face.,"I highly recommend this company. The mask is adjustable, high quality with a thoughtful design. Unfortunately it just doesnt fit my face properly. The eye cups are too round. Amazon doesnt handle the refunds so I contacted Manta Sleep directly. Their refund policy is 60 days and they responded very quickly and politely. The refund was processed the same day it was approved and credited back to my credit card by Amazon. Give it a try, you cant go wrong either way."
'4'.'0',Not perfect,"It does what you buy it for - blocks out the light. It uses velcro, so you have to play with the position of the eye cones and with the strap on the back of your head.  Nonetheless, it is a comfortable fit, and it does block out most of the light.  If I continued to play with the eye cones position I could probably get to 100% but the 95% I am experiencing is fine with me.  The bottom line is I am happy with it."
'4'.'0',This eye mask is very comfortable and the pads over your eyes are thick and cushioned nicely .. the way the pads are made they form a light barrier around your eyes they don't lay on top of your eyes .. so for all the ladies with extended eyelashes .. this one's for you! The pads have complete coverage no light seeping in anywhere! The material isn't flimsy and it's soft to the touch. Worth every penny!!!! i **** don't put in the dryer if you wash them **** I did and the pads aren't as firm anymore .,Would be perfect except the band placement on the ears!
'4'.'0',"I am a healthcare worker and work night shifts. Pair this mask with Loop ear plugs and I can sleep though anything.This mask does exactly what it says. It blocks all light and is very comfortable. Great quality and doesnt actually look awful. I want to buy the silk cups next.However! The band placement is off, I have to wear the band over the tops of my ears which makes my ears sore the next morning. If I wear it above my ears, I dont get the 100% light blocking.",Best sleep mask Ive owned
'4'.'0',"My previous sleep mask was not nearly as comfortable as the Manta mask.Ive been really happy with it.  The eye pads are thick and lush and give me lots of coverage.The material is soft and comfortable and it makes it easy to wear.I am really glad I went with this mask.  I wear it every night and it hasnt let me down yet.I havent tried removing the pieces and washing them, but I may do that soon.Go get one and get to sleep!","Very Good. Lightweight, Comfortable, Effective"
'4'.'0',This mask does the job  Definitely worth the small investment,"Good, but could be better."
'4'.'0',"It does a very good job of blocking out all the light. Its much more comfortable than a normal sleep mask, and keeps pressure off your eyes. I love how easy it is to wash too, just toss it in the included laundry bag and wash along with the rest of your laundry.I do find myself waking up to it having slipped off while I was asleep, so I wish it had a little more grip. Thats really my only complaint! Overall still a great product.",Works with cpap mask but not great
'4'.'0',"I bought 3 masks at the same time to try out and figure out which Id like best. One got returned, this one I kept but I wont order more. And the third I loved and have ordered extra. This one was ok but not as good as the third. Its fairly soft but its a bit too firm. If the foam an the eye rings were more squashible I think Id like it better. It fights a bit for dominance on my face with my cpap mask. I use a nasal mask so its a bit more forgiving than a full face mask but its still difficult to find an eye mask that is compatible. This one isnt it. I can see why people love this mask if they dont wear a cpap mask as well though. I can make it work with my cpap but the third mask I got works so much better that this one isnt work the effort.","Works well, a bit spendy."
'2'.'0',Expensive and suffocating to eyes,I was very disappointed with the product once I tried to use it. After having Surgery on my eyes I figured this would be ideal to wear at night while sleeping. It was too suffocating to wear throughout the night a uncomfortable. Too expensive to not feel comfortable
'2'.'0',Not for side sleepers,"If you sleep on your back, you should be fine.  But for side sleepers, it will move around unless you put it on super tight."
'2'.'0',It was not as we expected sadly,Too foamy for the eyes and my husband head hurts and got a headache from it so it sucked. But my parents liked it 3 stars XD
'2'.'0',"Blocks out all light, good for back sleepers","While I was hoping to protect my eyes from myself, a side sleeper, it came in contact with my eyes when I tried to sleep with it. Would be perfect for a back sleeper though."
'2'.'0',Not meant for stomach sleepers,"The product does well to block light, but it is not meant for stomach sleepers. With my face turned to the side or into my pillow, the thickness of the cups put too much pressure to the bony areas around my eyes."

'2'.'0',The cups are so thing you can see all the light coming through them,"It does stay on great every night it comes off. It is comfortable, but I worry when the hot summer nights hit that I wont wear it because it does breathe well. My eyes get hot now. :("
'2'.'0',Not for side sleepers.,She said it was fine until she rolled on her side. Not for side sleepers.
'4'.'0',Transformative for a good nights sleep,"This mask is superior to all others I have tried, and there have been quite a few.  I have a very petite face, and even so this mask is very comfortable.  The adjustable eye cups are so flexible to use, that I can arrange them to block nearly all light, and so that the mask doesnt compress the bridge of my nose like so many of the others Ive tried.  Also, really making this a great purchase is the masks ability to be washed in the washing machine.  I was hesitant to buy it because of the price, but it has been a worthwhile purchase after all.  Im sleeping much more soundly....and didnt have a true awareness of how the ambient light in my bedroom from various electronics was impacting my sleep, and then, how the morning light wasnt allowing me to compensate for sleep lost during the night.  With the mask on, Im sleeping much more soundly, and those odd nights where I am awakened, I can sleep later in the morning to make up for it.  If youre on the fence, Id suggest you give this mask a try. To present this fairly-  if there was anything other than the price that I would consider a slight negative, I wish the masks were designed to be more attractive- they look like athletic wear, and are kind of masculine, but still a great purchase."
'4'.'0',Splurge on the one for side sleepers,"This is my second manta mask. Love the light blocking. It's a bit warm for summer and the foam cups feel firmer/less comfortable than first mask. Velcro works better now. As a side sleeper, I'd soring for the one w the shaped cups. Lots of masks out there. I think manta is worth the $."
'4'.'0',"Blocks out light well, band is uncomfortable","This eye mask blocks the light well, especially since the eye cups and band are adjustable with Velcro. However, the 'side sleeper?? band is just uncomfortable. Tight and itchy around where the ears meet the head, I have woken up with pain and irritation in that area. I will try to loosen the band but if it's too loose it will not stay in place. Might be worth it to rethink the textile material around this area, Manta, go something much softer."
'4'.'0',Best Ive tried so far but could be better.,"Best out of maybe four masks Ive used.  The eye cups still leak light unless you get it just right and/or tighten it to the point the strap is too tight.  Also, the strap has to be in the right place to hold the mask just right, but shifting your head a time or two on the pillow pulls the mask out of whacks so....  Id put some more r/d into the band situation."
'4'.'0',"They don't block everything, but better then anything else I've tried","Hard to sleep on sides with them, but still sleeping better then otherwise since I'm sensitive to light."
'4'.'0',"Comfortable, but it GETS HOT","Love the product!  My husband uses it most nights, as I tend to stay up later, and the light disturbs his rest.Only complaint is as comfortable as it is, and as well as it blocks out the light and you can blink (doesnt press), is that it GETS HOT.(<<Update>>  I should clarify that we live near DC, and its humid here for a good portion of the year.  Hot happens.)So fall asleep and stay asleep?  No problem.  Wake up in the middle of the night, yep, they are coming off, because its hot.Ive heard that this company has made other products, and has an add-on that you can use to add essential oils somewhere to help you fall asleep and relax.  As long as it stays away from your eyes, its close enough to your nose that you could benefit from essential oils too.PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS HAS HELPED YOU by giving it a thumbs up - thanks!"
'4'.'0',Eye masks are necessary at times,"Well, I dont love eye masks but Sometimes i need one. So as eye masks go this one is fairly comfortable, fairly light, blacks out the light and does not touch your eyes. So it is a good eye mask"
'4'.'0',Not good with the CPAP,"In search of a eye mask that I could wear at night with my CPAP.  It is the most difficult thing to find.  The mask sits above my eyebrows when the mask is on, totally defeats the purpose of the purchase.  Without the mask this is a great product because it does not sit directly on the eyes allowing for the lashes to move."
'4'.'0',Most comfortable eye mask yet,"I was desperately in need of an eye mask that blocked out light, was comfortable & didnt leave me with headaches in the morning if I was even able to keep it on all night. The other masks Ive tried hurt my head from the elastic strap, sat too far down on my nose & only blocked 60-70% of the light. This mask with the eye cups is genius. It keeps at a minimum 98% of the light out (on my side just a bit came through), stays off of my nose and has an adjustable soft, wide velcro strap. For my particular head, the strap does lay over the top of my ears but after a few nights, I didnt notice it. Currently ordering my second one to leave at our cabin...I forgot it once & definitely slept worse without it. I am leaving one there so that doesnt happen again. I highly recommend spending the money as it is well worth it!"
'4'.'0',Best sleep mask ever!,"A really great mask, I love how I can adjust the cups, and the strap. Blocks out light, if your a side sleeper you will have to put the strip on right. Which can be uncomfortable, but I figured out how to adjust it comfortably. Also, if you go on manta.com They have one for side sleepers, silk and different kinds. I wish Amazon had every kind of manta, to fit the consumer needs. Amazon only has the basic manta face mask. The only thing I didn't like was because it's cotton I wake up in the middle of the night with a lot of sweat. That's why I went on the site to get silk. Overall it's the best sleep mask I ever had. I had every brand and manta is the best thus for."
'5'.'0',"I cannot even begin to tell you how much I love this eye mask!! Not only is it very comfortable to wear, but it causes me to have a complete blackout of light! I have slept with this in bright rooms and even while napping outside in my swing under the full sun and it's the best sleep mask I've ever had! I love that not only is the band adjustable but you can even move the eye pads! I didn't need to alter them, but I'm sure others may and it would be a godsend! The mask itself is very soft and with the thicker headband being adjustable, I'm able to adjust the exact fit that works best for me! Previous masks did not have an adjustable band or 'eye cups?? and I was forced to tie knots in order to tighten it, which caused great discomfort. I also had great difficulty with those masks staying put. I do place this under my shoulder length hair, as I've done with the others, and it stayed in the proper position. I'm not sure how well it would hold on short hair/no hair. If you are someone who needs the light to be 100% filtered out for sleeping well, this is the mask for you! Per my title, I give this 100/10!",Great Mask i almost cant sleep without it.
'5'.'0',"Love the Manta sleep mask sorry for the late review but i really wanted to test the product for a long time before I wrote an official review. Its a really good mask to use for sleep i been using it for over a year it helps me sleep when everyone is awake, and they have lights on, and I also like it for days when I sleep late, and it keeps the sun out of my face. Its a really great product its almost hard to sleep without it on anymore it becomes a really important item like if it goes missing or you cant find it, youre going to search your house and do your best to find it Because youll sleep better when you wear it.",Love love love will buy again.

'5'.'0',Fantastic. Finally a reliable sleep mask.,"I stupidly dont have black out curtains so in the last 3-4 years have resorted to eye masks to avoid disrupting my sleep in the early morning.While Manta Sleep Mask is probably double the cost of most youll see on Amazon, it is 100% worth the cost. Good sleep is priceless and the ROI has been huge for me.The velcro adjuster is so much more sturdy than the finicky buckle adjuster in others that becomes twisted and useless after a month. The eye cups are comfortable and fully black out light. Plus you can swap them out when they get worn out or to change to hot/cold models.Ive gotten some of my best sleep in a year since getting these. If youre on the fence, jump off it and get these."

Would definitely recommend.",Completely blocks out light
'2'.'0',"My previous sleep mask put pressure on my eyes so I thought I would try this, now I have pressure around my eyes which is worse to me. I also do not like the thick strap where both sides connect. It does block the light.","Amazing mask, terrible longevity"
'2'.'0',"I love this mask. It's completely changed the way I sleep. In fact, I've bought four of them??But that's the problem. I've bought four of them, because the Velcro is awful. If you attach this in the same location each night (as I assume most of us do as our heads are not drastically changing size into adulthood), then the Velcro wears out within months. I think I'm going to replace the Velcro on mine with something sturdier because I love the overall mask so much??but I shouldn't have to. It would be such an easy fix, and potentially not even more expensive. Such a bummer, because I'd probably buy a wider variety of these if I wasn't spending all of my money to replace Velcro.",Extremely uncomfortable
'2'.'0',"It does, indeed, provide total blackout, but it is THE most uncomfortable sleep mask I've tried, out of about 12. It's so heavy. I've tried to sleep with it for about two weeks and I never make it to dawn without ripping it off my face, as I discover when the light wakes me up.","its quite hard to review this product, its good, but its also mediocre.the pros are, its indeed soft. even if you tighten the strap, you can feel the pressure around your eyes, they are still quite comfortable to wear. they look good and stylish. they are sturdy. the c cup feature made this mask significantly superior than others.cons are, if you move around while sleep, the strap can be moved away from the crown of the head, which can cause uncomfortable sensation, with moved strap, mask position can also be affected (light leaking in). So i usually find myself tensed up trying to no move able while sleep, which causes muscle fatique. another con is the straps are too thick. also"
'2'.'0',NOT for side sleepers.,"I will say this mask is constructed of quality materials. If you are SOLELY a back sleeper or want to us it for travel, this mask is a good option. However, if you are a side sleeper, the mask is NOT comfortable at all as the oversized sockets which offer 'zero eye pressure?? actually create a great deal of eye pressure. I will be sticking with the $10 gel masks as they are much more comfortable for me as someone that always sleeps on one side or the other."
'2'.'0',"First this thing is hot. So much foam around your eyes!It is almost too adjustable. The eye cups are peel and stick Velcro which makes it almost impossible to get the fit correct. I found that once I finally got them in the ""right place"" there were still light leaks unless I tightened the strap to an uncomfortable pressure.",Nothing good lasts forever.
'2'.'0',Bought my first manta mask from touch of modern as a prototype. The eye sockets were large and roomy. The second and third replacements were also good but this last one the eye cups are smaller and they press on the eyeball if you lay on your tummy.,Did not meet my very specific requirements
'2'.'0',For my particular purposes I want a sleep mask that accomplishes the following:1. Blocks all light.2. Has enough room for blinking.3. Comfortable4. Can be slid down over the eyes without much adjustment for very quick use.5. Can be worn with large over ear headphones.1. ' Can block all light after a good bit of adjusting.2.

'2'.'0',"Blocks light and would be great if I slept motionless on my back.  But once I switch to my side the mask shifts position on my face and is both uncomfortable and no longer functions properly.  Also, velcro clasp creates a noticeable bump on the strap at the back of my head.  Will be returning.",BON Charge's is better
'3'.'0',"Works well, but feels cheap.","I paid a little extra for this one, as it seemed to be more a name brand than a generic and have recently had poor luck with generic. I receive this product, and it feels horrible to the hand. It feels fine while wearing it, but the outside feels horrible, and removing the velcro to adjust the eye cups had me worried the fabric would tear before the velcro released, and its not even particularly strong velcro. Overall it works very well as a sleep mask, but paying the extra for this brand is not worth it. Plenty of companies make the same mask for cheaper. Even if they didnt this one does not inspire confidence, and at the price it absolutely should."
'3'.'0',"Comfy, but maybe not the best for side sleepers","I had been using your run-of-the-mill sleep mask for a while, but didnt like a few things. First, it was not made of the most breathable material, so my face felt warm, almost sweaty. Second, it was a firm fit, and pressed against my eyelids. Figured there had to be a better option.At first blush, Manta seemed to solve my major complaints with the old mask. I could adjust the fit, and could open my eyes while still having them covered. The material felt great. But, I sleep on my side - and the cups of the Manta mask compress between the pillow and my face. Its just uncomfortable enough for me to notice and prevent me from falling asleep.So, its back to the old flat mask, for now."
'3'.'0',so far i like it but i have some issues with the original,"i definitely need to upgrade to the max size eye cups as my eyelashes are too long naturally for the size that comes with the original, and mine get stuck when i blink.  since i need to sleep with a mask for chronic dry eye and nocturnal lagophthalmos closing my eyes as best as i can and keeping the mask on while i toss and turn all night is pretty important.  which also brings me to the reason why i think i may also need to get the slim version for side sleepers as well, as i do tend to sleep on my sides and have a very small head.  i houdinid out of the original mask as-is on my first night sleeping with it."
'3'.'0',Not good unless youre a back,"I sleep on my side and on my stomach. This is problematic with the mask because it puts unnatural pressure on the mask against my face, making it hard to sleep. If I could just sleep on my back, this would be a great product. Sadly, it was a waste of my money."
'3'.'0',its back is better then other eye masks but should have a function to go around the ears instead to not have pressure on the back of the head. Unfortunately like all other eye masks I found it has a 20% opening at the nose area that lets light in making it useless and its hotter and more expensive then others. Still the back piece is better then other companies that have metal back their.,"Different than other masks. I was hopeful about this but it comes off during the night just as much and is uncomfortable in its own way. As others have said, it is very uncomfortable to sleep with this unless you're sleeping on your back. And oddly? Though the eye cups are supposed to reduce eye pressure, in some ways, I find them to create their own pressure, but in a different way.They are great at keeping all the light out, if they don't come off or slip out of place."
'3'.'0',The placement around the eyes feels very hard like a block of something (too sturdy) surrounding your eyes so its quiet an uncomfortable feeling. A memory,To each their own. It's not bad.
'3'.'0',"Honestly, I think the product is fantastic, but personally I don't find them to be comfortable. BUT! I love using them when I practice my meditation. So honestly, I like it, it has a purpose, sleep wise, it's not for me, maybe i should've got the heavier one for my eyes. I see ppl here enjoy it, and that's awesome, I'm happy to see it helps others get proper rest. Maybe I just need to try a different one. My sleep is terrible. But hey! For Meditation it works!",Not for side or stomach sleepers
'3'.'0',"First off, I do really like this mask, however, it is not for everyone. This mask only works as described perfectly, but only if you are a back sleeper or using it for use on an airplane/other mode of travel while you sleep in a chair.  The design does not remain reliable if you're a side sleeper.  Your pillow will push your eye cup out of place letting light in and put slight pressure on your nose.All in all I will keep this mask for travel, but this is not my go to mask for regular sleep",The cups for your eyes work great and block out all sun but the cups are also very thick so if you are a side or stomach sleeper it's too much. Presses into your eye sockets. These would be great for people if you only sleep on your back!
'3'.'0',Just a heads up: The multicolor version is really the Manta Slim version,"Update: they updated the pictures to reflect the features of the Manta Slim.Purchased the Manta sleep mask that was ""multicolored"" since it was the one that shipped using Amazon Prime. When I received it, I noticed that the strap that goes around your head needed to go into a loop and velcro onto itself, kinda like all cinching  straps. All pictures of the Manta do NOT have this feature. All pictures of the Manta have two straps that velcro together behind your head.When I saw this, I thought I received a fake item. After doing some research, I found out Manta also makes a ""Manta Slim"" which is exactly what this ""multicolor"" product is. Strange that this ""slim"" version is not on Mantas website through normal browsing, but is there when you do a Google search.Just a heads up that if you buy the multicolored version of this product on Amazon, you are getting the Manta Slim."
'3'.'0',Hurts the back of my head ?'?,"It does a great job of keeping light out with the comfortable eye pillows , I only wish that the strap in the back wasnt so dense and long. Theres no need to have a strap that long, nobody has a head that big. So lining up the strap to the velcro is cumbersome. It would be nice if the strap was wider so the fabric was dispersed more evenly against the back of my head,so it didnt put all of the pressure in just one spot, if that makes sense. If you made those changes I definitely change my rating score."
'3'.'0',"Not Perfect, But Not Bad","These things work pretty well, but are not as perfect as advertised.  Theyre certainly an innovative design and seem very well made with soft fabrics that are pleasing to the touch and (my favorite part) washable.  They dont retain heat or cause sweating, which is excellent, and unlike flat sleep masks they dont rest on your eyes.  With a regular sleep mask, the pressure on my eyes would cause me to wake with extremely blurred vision that would take a while to clear up...  Reading anything right after waking was a near impossibility.  With this thing, theres no pressure on the eyelids, so I wake up with perfectly refreshed eyes.  To achieve this, theyve created what are essentially 1"" thick foam donuts around your eyes, and while the thickness is what makes them work so well, its also their biggest flaw, as any sleeping position that isnt flat on your back becomes problematic.  Side-sleeping is tricky because, generally speaking, when youre on your side, one whole side of your face is being pressed into the pillow.  Normally, thats not an issue, but with these things on you have a 1"" thick foam donut to contend with, and under pressure, that donut becomes a bagel.  Sure its a nice, soft fabric and a pliable foam, but that doesnt really matter when its being pressed into your eye socket.  It adds a lot of pressure to your face, which can be distracting and disrupt sleep.  Furthermore the strap on the Slim model tends to rest right above the ears, which can rub and become irritating, particularly on the adjustable side of the strap, which is thicker and had more edging.Next, they claim 100% light blockage and while this is *almost* true, I couldnt find a fit that didnt create a small gap and let some light in at the nose/brow area, leaking light in through the space between the ""donuts.""  I found that the only way to eliminate the light was to either tighten the strap to an uncomfortable level or fill the gap between the donuts -a cotton ball might do the trick.  Now, its a tiny amount of light -certainly not enough to bother me- but its not 100% blackout.  Its more like, 98%.  And thats before you roll over, pressing the donut into your eye-socket and shifting the whole thing to the side.And finally, I have found that while the mask doesnt put pressure on the eyes, it does put pressure on the eye-sockets and brows.  I woke yesterday to find that my face was a little sore around the eyes, particularly where lying on my side had pressed the donuts into my eye-sockets.  Now, it went away pretty quickly, but still.Overall, theyre not terrible...  They do the job well enough and I think Id still choose them over a traditional flat mask, but theyre just not the miraculous perfection that claim them to be.  If you choose to try them, be prepared for an adjustment period.  The thickness of them does make them difficult for side-sleepers to deal with but I think once you get used to them, theyre pretty awesome.  And if you sleep on your back, theyre really pretty fantastic."
'3'.'0',"People rave about this mask so I bought it to try and use when I work night shift, but I couldnt stand it and ended up throwing a pillow over my face until I got a different mask. For me the main problem are the eye cups; they may not put pressure on your eyes, but the edges of the cups still put pressure on your face because of how big they are. Im also a side sleeper and the size of the eye cups made it so that this practically came off my face when lying on my side. To me it was just a clunky design that let light in and made my face uncomfortable. I understand theyve made a newer model, so maybe that one is an improvement, but I definitely wont be coming back to this version.",Not for side sleepers.
'3'.'0',"Not for side sleepers, uncomfortable pressure.",This blackout blindfold was a bit uncomfortable. And no it didnt do well for my narrow face despite claims that it would. Its expensive. I am still on the hunt for a sleep mask that doesnt permit ambient light from the sides while being a comfortable fit.
'3'.'0',Not ideal for side sleepers,"I bought this mask in hopes it would hold its shape longer than the contoured masks I usually buy, as Im sick of having to buy new sleep masks every few months because the old ones lost their shape.  Ive only used it once so far so I cant say how well itll hold up after a few months, but the design does seem more durable than the usual contoured mask design.Problem is that the eye pieces press into my face uncomfortably when I lay on my side, as the mask gets smushed between my face and the pillow.  For back sleepers I expect this wouldnt be a problem.The other issue is that, at least with my face shape, it doesnt completely block out all the light; it blocks MOST of it if I play around with the straps to get adjusted properly.  Still, if the shape holds up for more than a few months and so it continues to block the same amount of light, Ill be satisfied -- the reason Im always having to replace my sleep masks is because once they start losing their shape, their ability to block out light is severely hampered."
'3'.'0',NOT for side sleepers,"Let me preface this review by sharing that I wear an eye mask to bed every single night so the sun doesn't wake me up in the morning. I have found masks that work for me over the years only to have the manufacturer stop selling them. So, I am always on the hunt for true blackout sleep masks.This eye mask is such a great idea. By moving the eye pads around, you can get them to be full blackout, which I was super excited about. Then came bedtime. I am a side sleeper and these are TERRIBLE for side sleeping. It doesn't look like it from the pictures, but is you use a pillow at all, the eye cups hit your pillow and it's so uncomfortable it almost hurts.If you sleep on your back or will only use this for travel, you will be happy with this mask. It is true blackout and it's very small and light. It is really well made. If you are a side or stomach sleeper, keep looking."
'3'.'0',It hurts to sleep on your side wearing this,"These are exactly what I needed, total black out of light and more room for my eyes to open & close underneath. However, they are so thick, and customizable, that you move them so they dont cut into your nose and then they are so out wide on your face that when you sleep on your side the eye piece pushes hard into the side of your face around your eyes. Its truly painful by middle of the night. The light blocking is amazing though."
'3'.'0',"I was so hopeful for this product but if I loosen it at all, it doesnt stay on my face and I wake up without it. If I tighten it, it is too tight for my face and causes a panic.",I wanted to love this but I only like it
'3'.'0',It looks like it would work better than it does. Light still seeps through. Not the most comfortable/ effective device if you move around while you sleep. I do like the hook and loop closure but I expected more for the price.,"This is not a bad mask. To get the mask to seal, I have to tighten it. I have a deviated nostril. So, the masks cause a lot of nasal pressure.  If the eye covers were made of a softer foam I do not think this would be a problem. Overall the mask is good quality, though."
'3'.'0',Not Bad but not that good either,"The foam is flat and has no contour. Which means you need a lot of force to make it curve around the face and seal. Thats too much pressure, both on the eyes(surroundings) , and on the head band.Maybe its just the shape of my head? I am not really sure. but if I have really sleep with it, then its too much pressure.The head band is too thick. Especially since the velcro overlaps on the back of head, where you lie down. The overall bulk also means when turning my head around, it tends to get pressed and torn. That doesnt feel good.The whole thing feels soft and nice. But practically does not fit for sleeping. But if you just wanna lie down and take a power nap, it may be very good."
'3'.'0',"Took a little while to get used to, kept ripping it off my face at night, but it blocks out the light great, and after a week I was sleeping longer.",Side sleepers Beware !
'3'.'0',"I originally got this product so my eyelashes would not be squished. The mask is great for that purpose, has tons of space for your eyes, and keeps the light out.I think the mask would be great for back sleepers. But the eyecups are quite uncomfortable if you sleep on your sides. They interfere with the pillow and push on your face. Both nights I tried to use it, I ended up switching back to my old one in the middle of the night. My eyebrows would also be sore from the constant pressure of the eyecups.It might work for some sidesleepers, but for me it did not.",Adjusting the eye pieces on my own had been a challenge. Its comfortable enough wearing to bed but I never seem to have it on when I wake up. It seems to help with light going to bed.
'3'.'0',"I liked how soft and comfortable it was on my eyes, but the band kept slipping and the mask move up on my forehead while I was sleeping.  Might try a different version like the silk or weighted one instead.",Good but there are better options
'3'.'0',I purchased this and the Dreamlight Ease 3D sleep mask at the same time.  I wanted a mask that would allow me to drift off to sleep while my spouse watched TV from our bed.  I liked this mask at first but after a couple uses I became frustrated with the light leakage around the bottom of the mask.  It is also a little uncomfortable as the pieces over the eyes place extra pressure on my face when I lay on my stomach.  The material is very light weight and light does not penetrate through it; However it can leak through the bottom.  This item does not get warm in the same manner that the Dreamlight does so that is a plus.  I think it is a good alternative and much better than any of the cheap masks that I have used,Overhyped and overpriced.
'2'.'0',Not good if you sleep on your side,"Too stiff if you sleep on your side, covers eyes well, looks nice, materials could be softer or more plush. Probably ok for airplane travel in coach if you're sleeping sitting up."
'2'.'0',"Sorry, but no matter how I adjusted the eye mask it still was never comfortable to me. Those eye cups left pressure marks around my eyes. Had to return this product.","If you move at all, this is not for you"
'2'.'0',"If you move around at all at night, this mask is not for you. It slides out of place too easily and disrupts your sleep more than light does. Wrapping a t",Covers just 70% of eyes!
'2'.'0',"It is not covering 100% of my eyes, just 70",Actually not a great design for a sleep mask. The donut pads that cover your eyes do a great job blocking light but the overall strap of the mask is poorly designed: it gets stretched out easily and always slips down my face at night
'2'.'0',Not for side sleepers,"Excellent at blocking light, but uncomfortable for me, especially as a side sleeper.  Very bulky and stiff around the eyes.  Might be ok for a back sleeper."
'2'.'0',This was very soft but put too much pressure on the area around my eyes and even my temple if I wanted to sleep on my side. Would not recommend for a side sleeper.,Do not recommend'Falls off unless so tight it's uncomfortable
'2'.'0',Very light,"Back strap is too thick, side sleeping can be difficult"
'2'.'0',The back strap is too thick and is uncomfortable.  You feel this large indent on the back of your head while you sleep. Sleeping on your side is not great either.  The eye cups get pushed out of position easily.,Terrible for side sleeping
'2'.'0',100% Blackout w/ a Catch,"I can indeed get 100% blackout with these, but the catch is that to do it I need to make the mask so tight that its really uncomfortable. Also, the velcro fasteners for the eye cups are kind of a double-edged sword- in theory they provide infinite customizability for placing them on the mask, but in practice they make it impossible to dial in their position precisely. For example, you cant really move one of them 1/16th of an inch to block a little sliver of light because as soon as you tear off the velcro, you cant tell exactly where it was to begin with. Finally, the pressure of the eye cups on the top of my nose makes my sinuses hurt. If through sheer luck (because of the velcro) I happen to find a position for the eye cups that alleviates any of these issues then Ill update my review."
'2'.'0',Wish I could un,not comfortable for sleeping
'2'.'0',Digs into your ears.. horrible for side sleepers,"I have tried wearing this mask over my ears and above my ears and nothing is comfortable. You can either have your ears pinned or the strap digs into crease of your ear.If you opt for pinning your ears, you will wake up to the mask on your nose and temple instead of your eyes.Sleeping in your side also causes some eye socket pressure from the pads.At least it blocks light.Seeing all the good reviews honestly makes me question my reality ?'?"
'2'.'0',A couple pieces of foam and a few stitched pieces of velvet with a velcro strip. A basic version could be made with a $5.00 trip to an arts and crafts store but made in China and sold for the bargain price of $35.00. Doesnt really fit or work for me.,"They start off great, but they give out after a few months."
'2'.'0',Uncomfortable when you sleep on your side. It bunches up. Woke up with sore temples. Wouldn't recommend. Plain silk masks work better,Not for side sleepers....
'2'.'0',"Despite the claim that this mask was great for side sleepers, it definitely was not the case for me.  It smushed into my temple, for starters, and it didnt stay in place whatsoever.  Maybe it would have if I had had it super tight, but I started with it really tight and that wasnt comfortable at all.  Loosening it a little bit made it feel like it was still mostly snug, but when I woke up in the middle of the night, it was completely shifted and was no longer covering my eyes.  I had high hopes, but I returned it the next day.",Doesn't Work For Side Sleepers
'2'.'0',"The cups are firm and stick out pretty far so when your head is against the pillow, you're laying on top of half of one of the eye cups. This cup exerts a lot of force on the temple and brow of the skull. When I wake up, the mask is still in place and it blocks out light insanely well but the side of my head hurts because of the pressure against one side of my head all night. This mask would be amazing for any back sleepers, but you definitely shouldn't buy it if you're a side or front sleeper",I read all the reviews for this sleep mask and was hoping it would be right for me. Unfortunately it is too large and uncomfortable for me to use. I tried it one night and couldnt sleep. Not for me.
'2'.'0',Uncomfortable for Side Sleepers,"This mask really does work as intended and 100% blocks out light, so let me preface this review by saying that it does what its supposed to. To anyone who sleeps only on their back and doesnt shift throughout the night, you may actually have a good experience with this mask.However, as Im a side sleeper, I found it impossible to sleep on my side while wearing because the cups surrounding each eye are so firm that they dig and compress into my eye sockets. The eye cups are removable and are attached to the mask with velcro so they can be adjusted, but unfortunately the padding on the outsides of each is just too bulky with my head pressed into a pillow. Would have been much better had they tapered the cups so the outsides have less padding. Bummed I have to return this."
'2'.'0',Good quality but uncomfortable and not blackout,Interesting design that might work better with good quality memory foam rather than stiff cheap feeling foam.  Using stiff foam makes it so you need to tighten the mask too tight in order to get decent light blocking.  It also falls off easily and feels bulky.
'2'.'0',not for side,"Ingenious sleep mask that is adjustable and really blocks out all the light. BUT...only good if you lie on your back all night. As soon as you turn onto your side, the large foam rubber circles put sharp pressure just to the side of your eye. Very few people will be able to tolerate that--certainly not me. Dishonest to advertise this as good for side sleeping--its awful for it. But this is great if you sleep only on your back."
'2'.'0',"Really wanted to like it, but its not for faces like mine, I guess.","Great concept. Mostly very good product ... except for that all important part where its supposed to completely blackout light. Apparently not all faces are the same. Spent three nights trying different methods, but the only way I could achieve total darkness with this sleep mask was to put it on so tightly that it clogged my sinuses. A shame, that, because in almost every respect this is a stellar idea. The eye cups are soft, roomy and moveable (velcro). Likewise, the band itself is smartly designed so the velcro part doesnt ever touch the hair, and the fabric is soft and gentle all around. Design looks neat too. Just ... doesnt function well enough compared to sleep masks half the price."
'2'.'0',Don't waste your money,"Wanted to like this product because of the ads I've seen but it turned out to be a dud. The eye sockets protrude far too high off of your face making it a horrible experience for side sleepers and their necks. The mask also rides up when you sleep so was woken by daylight not the complete blackout experience I was expecting. The only good part about this was the adjustable strap. Don't waste your money on this. I found an $8 one that is far better with memory foam, space to open your eyes without them rubbing and complete blackout capabilities.The transaction itself was smooth. Product did not meet expectations."
'2'.'0',Great idea... but uncomfortable,"I see manta mask ads all over facebook so I thought I would finally cave and give them a try. When you put them on, unless you align them absolutely perfectly (and I only managed to partially do this once), they tend to let light in on the side. The fabric didnt feel very high quality. The mask itself wasnt very wide but the eyepieces kind of velcro in so if you have small eyes they may fit you better. I rolled over and put more of my face on the pillow in my sleep and the pressure of this mask on my face in the morning was very very uncomfortable. I would not order this again, and because I threw the packaging away gave it to my husband, who cant roll over with a cpap mask on so hes okay with using the mask."
'2'.'0',Not as comfy as hoped,Not as comfy as reviews would make it seem. Terrible as a side sleeper for me
'2'.'0',Not wearable overnight,"These are too stiff around my head and not wearable overnight.  I had a pair from 'air grip?? pillow that I loved and lost.  I replaced them with these.  Very disappointing.  The straps are firm and thick and put too much pressure on my head while I sleep.  I do have a very sensitive skull due to a head injury.  I preferred the one from air grip pillow, as the eye pads were softer and the clasp was less bulky on the back of my head."
'2'.'0',Not for side sleepers or anyone who shifts around while sleeping.,"I work graveyards and need to sleep during the day.  I use sleep masks to keep out the light so I can sleep.  This mask is the worst I have tried.  I always wake up to find the mask has come off in my sleep.  Never had that problem with other masks I have used.  If you are a side sleeper, it is really uncomfortable to have the foam eye cups pushed into your head.  They stick out way too far.  The concept of the moveable eye cups is nice, but they over complicated the design and made it uncomfortable to sleep with."
'3'.'0',"I had to fuss with the eye cups a bit to get them to a position where they didnt put pressure on my nose. However, in order to completely block light, I really had to tighten the strap, which put pressure around the eye cups and made the mask very uncomfortable. I went back to a lightweight Bucky. I let my mom try this one, though, and she immediately liked it. To each their own, I guess.","Worked well, but uncomfortable while side sleeping and I constantly had to adjust it."
'3'.'0',"Worked well, but was uncomfortable while side sleeping and I constantly had to adjust it. I had marks on my face from the mask when i woke up for hours, too. It was too bulky and would get knocked off or moved when I slept on my side. Wish I could return it but I already threw away the box and tried it out.",Not good for side sleepers.
'3'.'0',"I tried this for a about a week and a half and couldnt get comfortable with it at all. Im a side sleeper and this was not made for side sleepers in mind. Its made very well, with customization in mind, but couldnt ever get it comfortable enough. The opposite was true for me. I woke several times before a complete nights rest with the mask flung across the room. I subconsciously did this and was wondering why the light from the next morning was waking me up. Just wasnt a good fit for me.",Uncomfortable to sleep in
'3'.'0',Wanted to like this mAsk so much but it was very uncomfortable as I am a side sleeper and the eye cups kept pressing into my head.,Does not work well with a full face CPAP mask
'3'.'0',"Works well, but does not work well with a full face CPAP mask. So of limited use to me.","I had to get this because I just had eye surgery and I'm a stomach sleeper. Unfortunately the 'cushion?? around the eyes was so stiff and uncomfortable. If the masks shifts at all while you sleep, it digs into your eyes. Maybe this is better for someone sleeps on their back, but it is definitely not for me"
'3'.'0',Well engineered and over engineered at the same time.,"If you really have to have a completely zero light mask this is probably worth a try due to its customized fit options, but only if you only sleep only on your back. Side and stomach sleepers will find this too thick and bulky to be comfortable as the thicker part around the eyes will compete with your head and pillow for space."
'3'.'0',Poor design for side sleepers,"Product design is poor for side sleepers. The eye pads are thick and the mask slips when turning in bed and ends up putting pressure against eyes which is very uncomfortable. The materials are high quality, just want to clarify that. If they came up with a different design i would buy from them again. My boyfriend bought a sleep mask from them a few years back and i loved it.....bit the eye pads were thin and not uncomfortable."
'3'.'0',Not for side sleepers,"The eye cups work well for blocking light, but this mask simply is not made for side sleepers. The thickness of the strap isnt what matters for sleeping on your side; it is the thickness of the eye cups. If your head is truly on its side, then the eye cup will crush into your face somehow. Its not terrible, but this mask is far from ""the best sleep mask"" for side sleepers."
'3'.'0',Lightweight. Lets in some light. Bottom strap need to be wider,"Tried out different masks. Manta mask is relatively comfortable. Bottom strap need to be wider compared to the top strap (one with the velcro). With current design lining up strap with velcro to the bottom strap is not convenient.Some light does come in through the bottom part of the nose bridge. There need to be a nose bridge flap piece similar to the one used by Mavogel and other brands (Unimi,Reebent,Sontec: available on Amazon) to block light coming through the bottom side of the nose bridge.  Depth and comfort of the eye cushions are better compared to the other similar masks on Amazon. Price is high."
'4'.'0',Not for me but as advertised.,"I personally found this sleep mask to be like wearing a swim mask. It felt intrusive to me but DID keep all light out once adjusted. The fabric is like a tee shirt material which helps keep it from slipping I guess but I found it to be hot. I prefer a slick fabric as it seems to be cooler for me. The velcro type material on the strap is awesome and no way will it stick to your hair or anything else, which is a plus. Everyone is different and these are as stated and just not for me but it doesnt mean you wont like it. I will return these and try another kind."
'4'.'0',Complete darkness wearing them,I really like this sleep mask. Its totally dark when I put them on! Very comfortable although it did take time to get used to it. The sides are a little too thick and I have to wear them over my ears instead of over the top of them. Laying on my side with them wasnt comfortable at first but Im used to it now. My favorite sleep mask Ive ever had!
'4'.'0',Cuts into crook of ears,"Compared to the original Manta sleep mask, this ""minimalist"" version is marketed as being easier on the ears, which is true in one way but untrue in another. It is true that its band doesnt go around the ears, so it doesnt cause pressing pain of the ears like the original. However, its thin band, which is designed to sit above the ears, has a pretty abrasive edge and cuts into the crook of the ear. Trading one discomfort for another."
'4'.'0',"This product blocks the light and helps me sleep. I have washed it several times and it holds up nicely, the velcro doesnt get caught in my curly hair. The only downside for me is that the eye cups are a bit bulky and until you wear them in, side on tummy sleeping will be awkward.","Give it time to adjust, needs more ventilation"
'4'.'0',"The first night was a hard one for me using it. The second night was less so, and by the fourth night, I was able to sleep fine without it. My only complaint is that it gets a little too hot around my eyes. Other than that, I would put my face directly into something with it on and feel some pressure while I wore it.",Not as practical as they look.
'4'.'0',"While i will say its comfortable, it has not improved my sleep.  It does stick off the face too much to wear every day (im a nurse who works nights and sleeps days).  I was hoping to be able to put these on and be able to rest comfortably, however you notice you have these on.  Blackout curtains for me.","Great for sleeping on your back, top notch. Tough with a mask on (i.e. Covid airplanes). Also not great for sleeping on your side. Tends to fall off in the night if it's too loose and hurt if it's too tight. Overall, I love it as I've learned to sleep on my back, but I still use my cheaper regular sleep mask for planes and side sleeping."
'4'.'0',Almost the perfect sleep mask,The title explains how I feel. This sleep mask is nearly perfect except for one complain I have. The back on the mask where the straps connect via Velcro causes a little bit of discomfort when I'm laying on my back to sleep. Nothing terrible but I definitely notice it.
'4'.'0',What a great design. the pockets really block out all the sunlight. The whole item is very comfortable on your face. The straps are very soft too and doesnt fall off during the sleep like the others ive bought. I definitely recommend this product %100!,Took a few nights to get the fit right
'5'.'0',"Because of the cup design you can really tighten the mask without any eye discomfort and get a very good seal and a secure fit. Im a night owl/late riser, and when I wake up with the mask its so dark that I cant believe the sun has come up until I take it off.Despite the slightly higher price relative to cheaper masks, if light is something youre struggling with then the investment in your sleep is almost certainly worth an extra $15","Very comfortable and will help you sleep in full light conditions, I used it i my last trip to Bangkok... I wish I had this on my may other trips love it and highly recommend"
'5'.'0',"I've used these every night for the past couple of months, and I like that I can adjust the eye cups. Also, the straps that go around your head don't expand which is good since I can adjust them how I want while the other brands with elastic straps tend to lose elasticity over time.",Don't cheap out. Get this mask.
'5'.'0',"Ok, YES ' it's a bit pricier than other masks on Amazon?? but believe me?? you get what you pay for.I've tried many masks and this one is by far the most comfortable, blocks light perfectly, and actually stays on my face the entire night.It's extremely cushioned, so it's great for side sleeping, too.Because of the 6 hour time change, I wore this mask during the first few nights of my Europe trip to try to combat jet lag and get my sleep cycle back in rhythm ' and this thing worked better than any sleeping pill I've ever taken. The sensory deprivation of the complete darkness this mask created worked WONDERS! Thanks to this mask, I got excellent sleep every night of the trip.I highly recommend this mask.",Cozy darkness for midday naps
'5'.'0',These definitely do the trick,"I bought four different sleep masks online and they all leaked light. Most of them had shallow eye cups so you could feel the mask touching your eyelids. Too block out all the light leaking in I had to wear them as tight as a tourniquet.  Then I saw the Manta sleep mask on Amazon and I had to give it a try! The mask arrived an in a minute I knew I had found my key to sleeping into the morning. The deep eye cups are adjustable with Velcro so you can get a perfect fit. The soft eye cups let no light in. This is the best sleep mask I have ever owned, and I cannot imagine one could be better!"
'5'.'0',Comfortable to sleep with,"This thing is awesome! It comes with Velcro detachable eye pieces and the foam cushion around it perfect protects my lashes without causing any discomfort or raccoon eyes in the morning. Does the job, and was so worth it!"
'5'.'0',This is the best mask I have ever found! My nose has a high bridge which causes most sleep masks to let a lot of light seep on around the nose. The Manta mask has ultra deep eye cups that can be positioned in any place and angle.  They are thicker near the nose and less deep at the sides of your face which makes it comfortable for side or stomach sleeping. My sleep has never been better since getting this mask. Highly recommend!!,Comfortable and totally light blocking
'5'.'0',Love these enough to have several pairs in different versions.,Cant sleep without it.
'3'.'0',Great mask but not for side sleepers,"This is a very well constructed sleep mask. No issues with the materials or quality, its exactly as advertised. However the qualm I had was with the fact I'm a side sleeper and this mask is too bulky for my head against the pillow. It became uncomfortable and not easy to get used to.I am recommending this for back sleepers though. It will work perfect for you."
'3'.'0',Not good for side sleeping,"I was very excited to get these, but was very disappointed that they are painful when side sleeping. They are amazing at blocking out light. They are perfect for planes or sleeping on you back."
'3'.'0',Not great for side sleeping,"Blackout = 5 stars.  Its impressiveSoftness = 5 stars.  Its waaaaay softComfort = 0 stars.  Its not.  The velcro attachment overlaps and is bulky behind the head. Laying on my side, it squishes up my face and is impossible to sleep with it on."
'3'.'0',"Its unbelievably hard to get it just right to fit my face, almost needs a second person to assist in the setup.Im sure one day Ill get to a total blackout with this, but really",Movable eye cups are a neat idea but its straps are too uncomfortable.
'3'.'0',Too bulky. I could feel the strap on the sides of my head and behind it as well. I tore it off in the middle of the night because it was keeping me awake.,I was disappointed. In order to get it from blocking out all the light it has to be way too tight. Wish the top mask part was larger to help with this. Thought it would be better based in the other reviews.
'3'.'0',Est For Back Sleepers,"This mask is probably more effective for back sleepers.  I am a side sleeper.  While the raised eye area keeps the mask from resting on your eyes, the mask felt like I was lying on a rock.  It was very uncomfortable when lying on my side."
'3'.'0',Bought as a replace for a very similar mask that is no longer available. Found the Manta mask to be very lightweight. I would not describe this as 'weighted??. They eye cups are smaller than other masks but work ok with some positioning. Not as snug as a fit as others I've used but it works.,"Good for Back sleeper, meditators, chair nappers,"
'3'.'0',Side sleepers may find the cups press uncomfortably below the eye.  It digs into the soft area underneath the eye pushing on eye the ball.,Personally I found them to be too tight around my eyes.
'2'.'0',Best'ish...but waiting for a better design.,It would be really nice if this mask would stay on my head all night...without having to be so tight that it affected my ears negatively....but the blackout features are tied for the best of the 5 Amazon masks I've bought this year.
'2'.'0',"My husband says I have a baby head. This is just too big for my face. The eye pockets, which are fabulous in theory, are just too big.",Too bulky unless your a back sleeper
'2'.'0',These are too bulky and difficult to keep on if you sleep on your side or stomach.,Doesnt work for me. Too uncomfortable
'2'.'0',"I had high hopes for this mask, but it was the most uncomfortable eye mask Ive worn to","These do black out all light, however they really arent at all comfy.  Im a side sleeper, I would imagine they would be perfect for a back sleeper, but I cant wear them at all."
'2'.'0',I thought I would like the eye part but I realize I dont. Still trying to find a happy medium with this thing.,"The 2 circular pads make their presence felt.I tried loosening the back strap but, still."
'2'.'0',Too much pressure on eyes,The eye cups added too much pressure to my eyes and not comfortable for side sleeping.
'4'.'0',Noticed good results in just a few days,"Ive only had it about a week, but I am sleeping better. Not only does it block the light but subliminally, when I put it on, my brain is beginning to get the message that it is time to wind down and I am falling asleep faster than usual. When I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, I just slide it up to my forehead and then back down over my eyes. The soft, cushiony feel around my eye sockets is a nice, gentle pressure, and are deep enough that they dont press against my eyelids. The only thing that keeps this from a 5 star is the strap around the back would be better if it was a double strap with a high and low placement that might reduce slippage during the night as I am a ""rotisserie sleeper""."
'4'.'0',Works well not a total blackout tho,This mask doesn't completely block out the light unless you squeeze it on your face?? which would be uncomfortable and therefore counterproductive. The rings are just donuts that doesn't fit your face contours perfectly. Still very soft and the best eye mask I've bought-  the most expensive aswell.
'4'.'0',"It works really great, the only thing is by morning it always comes off my head.",Well worth it if youre a 3rd Shifter.
'4'.'0',The sleep mask itself is great!  It feels good while you have it strapped on and the Velcro fastener makes it stay on even through my chaotic sleep throws.  The earplugs that come with it are kinda meh though.  If you try to roll them to apply them properly in your ear.  They reform too fast and as a result I cant hardly get them in my ear canal. That was just a added bonus though and the mask itself is wonderful.  I highly recommend it.,Wonderful for nightshift worker
'4'.'0',"I really do love this product. Much more comfortable than other sleep masks. I thought the eye pockets would be a downfall because I thought I enjoyed weight on my eyes from a regular mask, but turns out those little pockets are heavenly (and adjustable!). They truly are blackout, zero light peaks in these babies. The only drawback is Im a back and side sleeper, so theyre bulky and uncomfortable when I roll on my side. Maybe this will change as I get used to them, or maybe Ill transition into a complete back sleeper over time. Im a night shift worker and these are a way better investment than blackout curtains. Its like a pure black abyss inside these guys!","I am a very light sleeper. And have a bright room in the morning. Any little sunlight wakes me up. This sleep mask is... ok..  it definitely blocks out about 95% of the light.  However,  the other 5% i see. The eye pads are round and holo so as to not press on your eyeballs.  But i would have rather it be a solid piece to cover my eye.  The  holo-ness allows you to open your eyes with the mask on. And that makes the part of the mask right in from of your eyes thinner. This allows just a hint if light in. Overall though, not bad. I still get more sleep with it on than i do without it. And its super soft and comfortable to wear."
'4'.'0',"It's better than the eyelid irritation from regular masks, and better st blocking light too, but it still doesn't line up properly over the eyes properly because of the nose.The eye pads should be a little thinner and arch inward a bit near the nose.","These are well designed and well made. They are very light weight.For me, it was uncomfortable trying to sleep with these on. I sleep on my back, so these didnt exactly fail, I just couldnt get comfortable."
'4'.'0',"I bought a few sleep masks and these are the best, if youre not a direct side sleeper or sleep on your stomach.  They stick out too far for those.  For a car, plane, or back sleeper these are amazing and the best you will find.",Almost perfect but not quite
'2'.'0',Only for back sleepers,"This is only for back sleepers. Impossible to wear for side or stomach sleepers, gets incredibly uncomfortable. Otherwise, works as advertised. Complete blackout."
'2'.'0',"The Mask is innovative, but very flimsy. It is terribly overpriced at $ 35.  I returned the product to Amazon .",Not for side sleepers
'2'.'0',"Works fine if you only sleep on your back. If you are a side sleeper it's pretty useless. It shifts too much and lets light in when you rollover. I kept waking up to adjust it, even tried moving the eye pieces/pillows but to no avail. 2 nights, same result. I had to return it.",Eye holes are pretty small
'2'.'0',I dont have an huge eye or head but this eye mask holes are too small and let light into them.  I am questioning all of the good reviews and wondering if they are real.,Dont get if you ever sleep on your stomach or even slightly on your side.
'2'.'0',"* The cups are huge and not suitable at all if you even slightly want to sleep on your side. The cups also dont significantly block out more light than a regular contoured sleep mask.* If you sleep on your stomach, the Alaska Bear sleep mask works great. Your eyelashes will connect with the sleep mask, but it doesnt affect your sleep much and that might happen with a contoured mask on a pillow anyway.* If you sleep on your back or on your side, get a good contoured mask.* Not everyone can get great blackout curtains or maybe dont want them because they dont look great. Good blinds and a good sleep mask work well enough.","just wasn't very comfortable, and having to find the right fit yourself was strange to me"
'2'.'0',Works Poorly and Causes Pain,"I like the concept and quality of the product, but the eye cushions never fit correctly over my eyes, so light always makes its way through. Additionally, they pushes on nerves around my brow causing discomfort even when loose and pain when tight.  Side sleeping is a no-go as it bulges out an inch and will push into your socket around your eye."
'2'.'0',Doesn't work with CPAP full face mask,"If you have to use a CPAP with the mask that covers both mouth and nose, the eye mask ends up sitting on top of the clear gasket that seals in the air. That means you're not blocking that light.If you have one of the smaller CPAP nose pieces that doesn't cover the bridge of your nose, you should be ok."
'4'.'0',"Probably the best sleep mask out there, but it didnt really help me","I got the sleep mask to try and help me with my sleep. I also wear ear plugs.Unfortunately, it hasnt helped me as much and I dont really believe thats to much fault of the company. It does what it does and it does it well, it blacks out light fairly comfortably, but side sleepers may struggle a bit.I often found myself waking up with the mask around my neck or completely off, and that may just be a personal issue. I tried to put it tighter but sometimes that would be comfortable.That said, the quality of my sleep didnt change that much so I contacted customer service and they helped me out. Definitely recommend it if you struggle with light."
'4'.'0',The best I've seen so far,"Probably the closest to full blackout I've seen so far. It's design does tend to make it stick out a bit further than most eye masks which makes some sleeping positions difficult.I've noticed sleeping on your side can cause the mask to shift a little and let a small amount of light in, though it's not unmanageable. The fact that the eye cups are Velcro'd in place means you can adjust for eye spacing and with some carful tweaking you can even adjust for some slight shifting when side sleeping."
'4'.'0',Great customer service,"I didn't realize the little black mesh bag was to wash the mask in, and I had washed it without it a few times. One of the eye cups lost its shape, and they quickly responded with a new mask for me.I like this mask because it's not as hot as other masks, and does block out more light.  It is also more comfortable because it's not pressing on my eyeballs, lol."
'4'.'0',not the best for side sleepers,"it took some finagling but the 100% light blocking does work with (probably) all faces due to their adjustable eyepad design. I am a side sleeper and am still going to use it because its velcro in the back which makes the band more resistant to stretching over time, but it does smoosh against my face/nose a little when pressed against the bed."
'4'.'0',Blocks out ALL light; Read for tips!,"This really does block out everything IF you have it adjusted correctly. Once its on you have to fiddle with the eye ""cups"" a bit for it to block out the light around your nose. Literally takes a second though. I have a smaller face and I find that the tightest option is still fairly loose on me. Thats a little disappointing. The cups dont smash my eyelashes as bad as other eye masks. (My eyelashes are natural, but very long.)Side sleepers: In order to protect your forehead from wrinkling with this on, make sure you gently lift up the top of the mask once you are settled in onto your pillow. If you dont do this, it can ""scrunch"" up your forehead a bit and may cause wrinkles."
'4'.'0',"Best thing out there, def perfect for travel.","Its almost perfect. If the foam cups were a little bigger it would be easier and you wont have pressure on your eyes when laying on your side. But honestly its the best thats out there, really comfortable and great for travel. I used to use it everyday but I sleep a lot while I move so it kinda moves around. It would be great if the band was designed way above the ears so that the band isnt irritating the ears"
'4'.'0',Comfortable and completely black out. Dont expect the elastic strap to last.,"It is surprisingly comfortable and completely blacks out all light.Plenty of adjustability with the Velcro backing on each eye cover.It never became gross and does a good job of repelling dust, dirt, grime, and smells.The elastic strap stretches and looses quite a bit of strength. If my head was any smaller, it wouldnt work after a year. You could always add a new connector or closure."
'4'.'0',Blocks out all the light,It takes some adjusting and I mean you adjust it sleep in it and then adjust it some more to fit correctly. The eye covers come completely off and can be adjusted. Theres also a strap on the back that adjusts which you can see from the picture. It doesnt touch your eyelids which bothered me about other eye covers. I work nights so until we get new blackout blinds these are great.
'4'.'0',Best for smooshy noses,"My nose is such a pushover that any mask I tried using basically collapsed it and made it hard to breathe. This one works great because I can separate the cups further apart and allow room to breathe. I would say that if I was buying it again, Id get the cool cups and the slim band. The cups arent necessarily warm, but having a cooler material would feel much more refreshing. The band works fine but I dislike that it has to sit across my ears to fit properly."
'5'.'0',Blocks out light and no pressure points on my face,Best sleep mask on the market.
'5'.'0',"As someone who is very sensitive to light when trying to sleep, Ive tried countless sleep masks over the years, but this one is truly the best Ive ever used. The adjustable strap ensures a perfect fit and the mask itself is incredibly soft and comfortable against my skin. It also provides total blackout, even when my wife insists on watching TV in bed. The contoured eye cups design keeps the mask from pressing against my eyes or face, so I dont wake up with any redness or marks. Ive even noticed that the mask helps me fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Overall, I am so impressed with the Manta Sleep Mask and I would highly recommend it to anyone who struggles with light sensitivity or trouble sleeping. Its definitely worth the investment for the quality and comfort it provides.",I really enjoy the eye cups! I can fully open my eyes while eating the mask and it makes it feel like the room is 100% dark! Very comfortable.
'5'.'0',Great for All Sleepers,"Ive used a fair amount of sleep masks, and this one is the only one Ive used that does what it says it does: 100% blackout. Its beautiful. These eye cups cradle your eyes like sweet baby angels cupping their tiny hands over your eyes all night. But instead of exploiting child labor, this mask works for free (after purchase of course). Ambient light is one of the worst things for your sleep, and sleep is one of the best things you can do for yourself. SO: you, yeah you, cough up the dough and buy this thing. Its worth it.Im mostly a side sleeper, and while it does take some adjusting to get this thing positioned right, it doesnt bow out like the cheaper ones and let in light over the nose bridge. And it definitely doesnt press down on your eyes. I can even blink in this thing and not feel my lashes rub against the cups. This thing also holds up in the wash (if you use the mesh bag it comes in to wash it), and thats great. I sleep like a rock with this thing on. Not THE Rock, but LIKE a rock. Maybe like the Rock, too. On that note, its not all about drive and power, its also about a good nights sleep, and this mask will provide. Sleep is the one thing you cant afford to sacrifice, so I think this slightly-more-expensive mask is worth it.The one caveat: if you have a massive head, first realize that it doesnt mean you have a better brain (its probably actually less efficient than smaller-headed people), but second, this mask miiiight not fit comfortably. I like to wear it looser so I dont notice it as much while I sleep, so if you plan on that too, keep this info in mind. With easy returns, its definitely 100% worth a shot!"
'5'.'0',Kept My Eyes From Drying Out / Very Comfortable,"I purchased these since I was having severe (and painful) morning dry eye.  I may suffer from nocturnal lagophthalmos which is a condition whereby your eyes open slightly when sleeping.  These kept my eyes from drying out.  My eyes are nice and moist this morning and I did not even have to apply eye drops (which is my ususal routine).  I have thrown away several black-out masks that use the soft ring (or cup-like feature) that is intended to keep mask material away from your eyelids.  The problem I have found with some is that the ""cups""  feel like suction cups on my eyes and are very uncomfortable.  Not these.  They are very gentle around the eye socket even when laying on your side.  I have also rejected sleep masks with adjustment buckles since I find these to also be uncomfortable in certain positions.  So Im very happy these adjust with velcro and incorporate some elastic so they can easily be removed without having to re-adjust the velcro each time.  I think these were very well thought-out by somebody and this is why they are so popular.  I was not paid or compensated in any way for this review."
'5'.'0',"This product changed my life! If you have tried a cheap sleep mask and found it helpful, then you will love this. Nuff said.Lefty","I have been with Manta since inception when it was offered as a crowd fund item. I loved the initial creation, however this item is even better.Stitching and quality are superb, fit is excellent. I own 2, and take one wherever I go. Fit is simple to change/adjust and there is plenty of room for above average eyelashes."
'5'.'0',"Fantastic.  Been using it nearly every day since I got it.  Reallys helps when taking naps, especially during car rides.  Can get a little hot and annoying some nights.  But, easily the best eye mask Ive tried.","Purchased as a gift for the wife. She typically uses a sleep mask but requested this type. She reports that it is very comfortable, and she sleeps better with less pressure on her eyes."
'5'.'0',Most amazingly comfortable mask,"Normally, I use the silk eye masks for sleeping, but these are actually way more comfortable, butter soft, and able to open your eyes with them on and still be comfortable and fully dark even when the lights are on in the room."
'5'.'0',Finally found the one!,"Ive tried dozens over the years, this is literally the only one that blocks all light, stays on my head, and doesnt touch my super long eyelashes. Well done!"
'5'.'0',Comfortable and blocks out light.,Loved them so much I bought another pair for a friend who works over night
'5'.'0',"I have very deep socket eyes and most sleep masks let in a lot of light. With the large soft padded, deep eye covers that are even adjustable this mask is very comfortable and blocks all light. Absolutely worth the money.","This is the most comfortable eye mask I've had. You don't see anything through this mask, and it doesn't leave that pressure feeling on your eyes or nose. It's very adjustable. You can move the eye pads to any position."
'5'.'0',Highly recommend! Great Product,This is such a great mask so comfortable! Blocks all light out.
'5'.'0',Love this for my eyelash extensions!!!!!!,This is the best eye mask Ive found for my lash extensions (and Ive tried a lot)!  It doesnt bend my lashes and stays on well (I am a side sleeper).  It also blocks out light completely which makes it an amazing mask even if you dont have eyelash extensions.
'5'.'0',Never buying any other sleep mask again,Is it crazy expensive? Yes.Is it the best sleep mask you can buy? Yes.These are the only true blackout sleep masks Ive ever used
'5'.'0',It is lightweight and the eye coverings are adjustable. Fits snuggly without being too tight and very good at blocking out the light. Ordered a second one to take on business trips,"Enjoying much better sleep at night with this wonderful, plush sleep mask.  Nothing else will do for me now."
'3'.'0',Best for only sleeping on your bacK!,"After several nights use, the mask works only well when sleeping on your back. This was disappointing because I always sleep on one side of the other. The eye cups do well for blocking the light but do not allow for comfortable sleeping on ones side, they are just too thick. The lack of side sleeping comfort is the reason for the rating above."
'3'.'0',Not good for prone or side sleeping in my case,The mask blocked out all the light. I am a prone and/or side sleeper. The mask was not at all comfortable when trying to sleep in those positions. The padding on the lower part of the mask felt uncomfortable around my cheek bones. I tried various combinations of strap positioning and it did not help. Returned for refund.
'3'.'0',"Good for back, not for side or stomach","Does this block light? Yes. Does it allow you to sleep on your side or stomach without feeling like you are laying down with glasses on? No.This would probably work just fine for solely back sleepers, but if you turn on your side or stomach youll likely find yourself adjusting the mask since it moved and was pushed and trying to find a good spot to rest your head. I end up tearing this mask off before I get to sleep because of that."
'3'.'0',Not great for side/stomach sleepers,"On theory this is a great product. It blocks out light pretty well. As a side sleeper though, this did not work for me.What would happen is that the cup would end up putting pressure in my eye. Since the cup is adjustable I kept fiddling with it to see if I could keep this from happening, but alas was unsuccessful. After 3 nights of restless had to stop using it."
'3'.'0',Not for stomach sleepers,"These would be great if I didnt sleep on my stomach. I find that I need to reposition the mask because my pillow would move it as I moved around in bed. The extra pressure applied from the pillow also restricted my breathing enough for me to get annoyed and have to take it off. Otherwise, they would be great for anyone else."
'3'.'0',"This product works similarly to the original Manta Mask but this one has a slimmer backstrap.My original lasted me for years before the velcro backing wore out.  This one works almost as well in blacking out but it is not as comfortable.The newer design should last longer than the original, but if I was going to make a new purchase I would wait on the silk model to come out.",Not great for side sleeping
'3'.'0',I tried for about 3 weeks and never could get used to it. I'm a side sleeper and I find it puts pressure on the side of my eye socket. I also toss a little bit and this thing always moves when I switch from side to side. I tried to make it tighter to stay in place but then it gave me a headache. Overall it didn't help my normal sleep but I have used it on the plane a few times and it's been great for that so I'll keep it. Unfortunate because I was really excited for it!,Found it uncomfortable and couldnt stop light from getting in around my nose. Not worth the $35.
'3'.'0',Not for side sleepers,"The mask blocks all light and is very comfortable when I first put it on, but I am a side sleeper and it seems to be made for back sleepers. I wish this had been mentioned in the description. When I am on my side, the bottom part pushes into my brow bone and temple in an uncomfortable manner. It also pushes the top cup upwards, allowing some light in.  If you are a back sleeper, I highly recommend, but side sleepers keep looking!"
'3'.'0',They need to be tight to stay on,"Soft and covers the area. The eye donuts are adjustable and thats helpful. The design is great in general but to keep it on and in place, it has to be tight."
'4'.'0',"Not 100% blackout, but 99% is good enough for me.","So far Ive really loved this product. My experience has been that at least when sleeping on my side, I cant usually get 100% blackout without a /lot/ of adjusting. That said, I dont need 100%, I just need something to block out most of the light, and having a physical item that makes me sleep and keeps me from checking my phone every 4 minutes. Very comfy, doesnt make me overheat, doesnt get tangled or anything. I am thinking of trying out the weighted band soon, as I sleep with a weighted blanket and the concept of something similar in a sleep mask to me is super duper appealing. Overall, I think this mask has worked great for me. But as some of the other reviews have said, esp for side sleepers it falls a little short of total blackout without a lot of adjustment. Keep that in mind of its something that would be a big problem before buying."
'4'.'0',"Great mask for back sleepers, side sleepers YMMV","I like this mask a lot, and usually wear it as Im falling to sleep. But if I rollover to my side, the cups dig in a bit too much. The eye cups do a great job of giving total blackout. If youre someone who enjoys staring into TOTAL darkness to rest your eyes, this is great even if it winds up coming off during the night.I just wish the eye cups were about half the thickness, or a little cushier. Theyre like a memory foam material which is good for stability and keeping bits of light out, but theres a comfort tradeoff unless youre a back-only sleeper."
'4'.'0',"Great mask, poor Velcro","I should have bought it straight from Manta. This one seems to be a knock off because the Velcro is not very strong and the outer covering is not quite large enough to cover the eye cups. It still gives complete blackout and is comfortable. I owned a real one from Manta before and loved it, but sadly left it in a hotel room. I ordered this one as a replacement and it will do, but just isn't quite as high quality as what I had before."
'4'.'0',It is comfortable  but the stick is little bit loosen after 6 months,The flexibility to remove the eye cups made the difference
'4'.'0',When I first tried these I didnt like them at all. As a side sleeper I found that one of the eye cups just dug into the side of my face and pushed the whole contraption out of whack. However... since the eye cups are held in place with Velcro,Tried so many different eye masks for cpap user. This one is the best to block out the air from the machine. Highly recommend for that purpose and comfort.
'4'.'0',Best sleep mask Ive ever owned,"Ive used sleep masks for at least 20 years as I used to work overnight. I have tried every type of sleep mask on the market, and I was a bit skeptical of this one. It is the most comfortable mask I have ever had, and it provides the best eye coverage I have ever seen (or not seen, I suppose). The ONLY drawback to the mask is that after months of having it I have had to tighten it a couple of times as it does stretch out from use and the straps will fall down the back of my head. Even with that I still get a seal over my eyes and it does not wake me up from any discomfort."
'4'.'0',"The mask is very soft and comfortable, and after adjusting the eye cups (they velcro on) it's hard to notice it's on!??that's what my review would be if I was a back sleeper, at least.I love the mask, and it is actually very comfortable, but I find myself adjusting and fiddling with it when lying on my side. The pillow likes to push against the eye cup which can either cause light to seep in or just be uncomfortable.I like the mask and don't think I'll return it, but be aware if you're a side sleeper that it can be uncomfortable. That being said, I think this would be perfect for travel or for back sleepers.",Works great with a nasal CPAP
'4'.'0',"I have bought SO MANY different eye masks trying to get one that fits well and blocks out all light while Im wearing my CPAP. None have worked all that well until this one.I use this over top of my CPAP straps because the eye pads are thick enough to allow it, and being able to position the eye cups wherever they work best is a godsend.The only thing I dont like about this mask is how expensive it is, but I guess Ill see how long it lasts before needing replacing to decide if the $35 price tag is reasonable. I feel like it was a necessary purchase though, even if I dont like the price.",Persistent strong chemical odor
'3'.'0',I really wanted to love these,"They dont block light any better than the $10 deep cup masks here on Amazon and honestly I dont even find these to be as comfortable as they are. The cups are a little too small diameter wise and *so* deep that they kinda collapse into the corner of your nose/eye, super awkward. No matter how I adjust them I just cant seem to make them work for me. Definitely not comfy for this side sleeper."
'3'.'0',"Good, but not $40 good. Comfortable and blocks 100% of light once adjusted right, but overall quality doesnt match the price (maybe $25 or $30 max)","Comfortable, but not for everyone!"
'3'.'0',"This mask is a mixed bag for me. When I first tried it on, I was blown away by the complete blackout these provided. Yes, these are 100% blackout!Unfortunately, I had not tried them in the real world yet. The minute I laid down on my side ( Im a side sleeper), it was game over. They felt bulky, and wanted to shift. In order for them to remain in one spot, you had to adjust the strap pressure very tightly, but this just added to the resistance of them wanting to moved. Depending on how soft your pillows are, might determine if these can be used for ""some"" side sleeper (your mileage may vary). I have temperPedic pillows, so this definitely did not work.For those who frequently fly, and those who sleep on there back, this might be perfectly fine, but side sleepers, look elsewhere.",Maybe it's bc I have a small face but I had trouble getting it to Block all light and be comfortable enough to sleep in.
'3'.'0',Believe only the 3 star reviews.,"There are several reviews on here that sums this product up well- good, not great. Definitely not the end all be all their advertisements claim it to be.First, as others have said, 100% isnt really true. While the eye cups are intuitive, any wiggle of the face or movement on the pillow breaks the seal and lets just as much light as any other sleep mask.2nd, again as others have stated, while this mask doesnt push on the eyes, it does push on the sinuses, bones, etc around the eyes. And since the eye cups are thicker than a normal eye mask, it exasperates both issues as a side and stomach sleeper.So while not a bad sleep mask, per say, their corny, infomercial like advertisements are peddling just another overblown product."
'3'.'0',"Great in theory, too light to stay on my (bald) head","I work overnights and sleep during the day.  In my opinion, this brand has hands down the best sleep masks for keeping light out.  I have the weighted mask, and it is my absolute favorite except for the strap that goes around the back of my head; its rather clunky and I can feel the ""bulge"" of the strap when I lay on my back and can be rather uncomfortable sometimes.  I figured Id try this slim style to see if it would help... and it does!  The issue is that the mask as a whole is so lightweight that it constantly slips off my head - I tend to toss and turn.  I feel that if the weighted mask came with the slim headband, it would be a home run - and I mean a friggin grand slam.  But until then, back to the weighted one for now... Id rather take the time to find the comfortable spot with the clunky headband than have the mask fall off and wake me up multiple times.  Sigh."
'3'.'0',"This one is just not good, and I'm sorry to say it because I REALLY wanted to love this.I am an RN with a history of a weird sleeping schedule. I bought this based on the good reviews on their website and amazon prime's free shipping. I had also seen an ad for them on Facebook. They have great marketing! The first night I loved it. (I think i was just not used to wearing a face mask and itwas just better than nothing)All other nights were down hill from there.My biggest complaint is how hot this mask is. I am NOT a sweaty female AT ALL. Like literally borderline freezing all of the time. But my face and eyes would literally sweat underneath this mask, and i would wake up horribly itchy and uncomfortable. I looked on their website and you can buy their cooling pads... for an additional $20","Worse than a cheaper MZOO blindfold. No better at blacking everything out, but more bulky and awkward to wear."
'3'.'0',i shift around at night and the mask has a tendency to slip off of my face,Strap uncomfortable around back of head
'5'.'0',no cap add this to your sleep stack fr,Truly keeps it dark. Good for C-PAP too!
'5'.'0',"I wear an eye mask every night. But I also use a CPAP machine. Many masks Ive tried, end up letting in some light because it does not fit over my CPAP mask very well. I am happy to report that this particular eye mask does fit well even when wearing a C",They were super comfortable and completely effective during my travels to the lands of midnight sun. I will bring these on all my travels from now on.
'5'.'0',Great with my Cpap Mask,"I got this in the mail yesterday and used it for the first time last night. I wear a full face Cpap mask, exactly like the one I included a photo of. These fit nicely on my face under the Cpap which helped make sure it stayed in place all night, even with my tossing and turning. I'm a side sleeper mostly and these worked great. Complete blackout. I've tried many other masks before and they always come off over night. Even without the Cpap mask  helping hold it in place I think that it still would've stayed on. I have very long natural lashes and hate how I can't blink with most masks on. That's not a problem with these! I was able to blink without issue. And I know that the company has more eye cups you can buy on their site, one of which is an even deeper eye area in case you might need that.I bought these partially because I need completely darkness to sleep but also to wear after my upcoming Lasik appointment next week. I wanted to make sure I couldn't rub my eyes in my sleep. And that the air from my Cpap mask didn't dry my eyes out even more than they are going to be already.I will try and remember to update this after more use."
'5'.'0',Best travel must have!,"Had a 17-hour travel day to Israel.  Ive used many eye masks, but this one tops them all!!"
'5'.'0',No pressure on your eyes and it really does block 100% of light.Its also light weight. very comfortable.,I thrilled with the product. This lets me sleep and wake naturally.The best!
'5'.'0',Game changer. I hate sleeping without it now,"This is the best sleep mask I have ever owned, it blocks out all light, super comfy, fully washable.  You cannot go wrong with this mask."
'5'.'0',"Soft and Comfortable, adjustable eye straps",It worked great! I used it for sleeping on the plane and Hotel.  I did sweat some but the mask absorbed the sweat.
'5'.'0',"I was hesitant on purchasing this because half the time I buy things to get better rest and it doesn't work; however, this product actually works. I work an odd schedule and before this mask, I would wake up and see the sun out, thus it would be hard for me to rest knowing I was spending my day sleeping for work. After buying this, I have slept up to my alarm and i have gotten some of the best rest using these. These are also very comfortable to wear as well no matter your sleeping position. It's well worth the purchase.",Big and bulky but super soft and comfortable
'5'.'0',My friend recommended this eye mask and so I figured I would give it a try. This eye mask is overall fantastic,Great for nose issues
'5'.'0',"I have a big nose, normal masks end up having gaps because my nose pushes it off of my face a little, and I also have issues with tighter masks putting too much pressure on my nose which makes me unable to breathe, this mask solves both problems. The eye cups are Velcro and can be repositioned to get a perfect fit, they are extremely comfortable, and the strap is also very comfortable. I think the price is still a little high for the product, but I am completely happy that I purchased one.",I love how mask eye cups are adjustable and the velcro doesnt get tangled in my hair. It is very comfortable to sleep in and blocks lots of light. I highly recommend this product.
'5'.'0',LOVE Manta eye masks!,"This is the best eye mask EVER! Totally blackout mask. Will accommodate back/side sleepers. The Manta company apparently no longer sells this specific product, but I was lucky to find it on amazon. I should order several more! I wear it nightly, and they can be laundered. However, after about 18 months, the elastic stretches out and I replace it. If you're looking for a perfect eye mask, THIS IS THE ONE!!!"
'5'.'0',The best sleeping mask!,"I usually don't write reviews, however this deserves a review. I work night shift and previously used a cheap sleeping mask that never helped me get a goodnight sleep. This mask is soft, comfortable and gentle on the eyes and instantly blocks the light making it easier to fall asleep. The adjustable velcro strap stays on well and it's not tight around my head. I highly recommend this product for those who work night shift or just have trouble sleeping at night."
'5'.'0',"I have tested a few different eye masks over the last eight months.  Manta is the best so far.  Could use a bit more space for ones eyelashes, but that isnt a deal breaker.",100% Comfortable Darkness!
'5'.'0',"My wife is breastfeeding our newborn and turns the bedroom light on for feedings. This mask is perfect.  It blocks out 100% of the light, is comfortable and adjustable. I am a stomach sleeper and this is as about as comfortable as it can get with a pillow in your face. The eyeholes are perfect thick pillows for your eyes and allow you to blink without touching the mask. This is adjustable to any adult face and size.",Can't sleep without it
'5'.'0',Ever since I started working night shift I've needed an eye mask to sleep. This eye mask is unbeatable!! It's extremely comfy and it blocks out ALL the light!! I can't go to sleep without it!,"I got this mask because I have been having issues getting/staying asleep. I work overnights and have to sleep during the day. It's super adjustable where the eye cups go and the head strap. Once I got a proper fit on the eye cups, it was blackout. It's super comfy to wear and I'm a side sleeper."
'4'.'0',This mask is better than any other for on in regard to total darkness. There's no place for light to slip in. The only downside is sometimes it helps it keep out the light also creates a little pressure around the ocular space.,BEST LASH SLEEP MASK - dont waste money on cheaper ones!!!
'4'.'0',"I would give this 5 stars but am only giving 4 bc there could be major improvements if your a lash wearer. I have lash extensions, I didnt want to pay the high price, it wasnt on sale when I bought it either so for this 35$ sale I would have been grateful. It could be a little better but for the most part as a CRAZY stomach and side sleeper its made it so I dont have to pay extra when getting my lash fills. So for someone who isnt such a crazy sleeper like me it would work amazing. but for us hard crazy stomach sleepers so far this is the best one I have found. Do not waste money on the cheaper ones. I have not used the silk one, but its the same size so I assume its the same as far as keeping on lashes goes, I could be wrong... It also comes with a little zip bag to place it in when you wake up, and the eye holes come off if u need to wash it, for someone like me who is 100000000000% into night skincare serums and routine it looks ""dirty"" faster but you can wash the holes and all of it if u wanted to. stays in place for the most part good, once in a while it will slip off if im sleeping really hard. in conclusion, this lash protection eye sleep mask is the best I have found online or in stores. Worth it if you constantly get fills and individual lash extensions. If I had the money I would design one that would be perfect but sadly I dont :( so this will do for now <3 hope this helps...","I thought this would be good since the fabric is stiff and wont lose shape but I found the fabric to be too stiff. in the middle of the night, I found myself adjusting the velcro because it was too tight on my head. The sound of that velcro in the middle of the night was very loud. I thought it would wake up my husband.  The good thing is the velcro didnt stick to my hair. When sleeping on my side, the eye cups dug into my face. It is of good quality. There was a lot of thought that went into making this adjustable. It just didnt work for me."
'4'.'0',Preforms how it should and works great. Except it causes puffiness that I never experience otherwise in the morning. It also seems to pull my skin which gives me anxiety about it causing wrinkles. I sleep on my side and it seems to shift my eyeball to the side lol the foam around the eyes is really firm,Very comfortable. Little light was poking through but i think its my face shape.
'4'.'0',"Great on build quality, no so much on comfort","I recently purchased a MZOO sleep mask, which I ended up being quite satisfied with. However, the strap started to stretch and I found that I was constantly tightening it to compensate (and this was only three month after purchasing it), so I began to search for something more durable. After reading other reviews, the Manta sleep mask seemed to fit the bill and I decided to give it a try. Out of the box I could tell that this thing was built to  last (and at about $30 it better be). The inside of the straps are lined with a really soft material and are secured in place with a microfiber strap, similar to velcro, and are advertised as triple-reinforced. They did not give easily, so I could tell they would not stretch and be permanently damaged as easily as my previous mask. Hmmm only complaint with the strap is that because of this extra reinforcement, it's hard not to notice the feeling of the strap putting pressure on your head as you sink into the pillow, even after 15-20 minutes when you would normally forget you have a mask on.The eyelets are moveable, but did not move themselves over time, as someone said in another review. They block out about 95-100% of the ambient light, but are not quite as comfortable as the MZOO mask, which is why I'll be returning mine. I am both a side sleeper, as well as a back sleeper. Thus, softness is crucial. I found that since the eyelets on the Manta sleep mask are rather firm, they would put more pressure on the area around my eye if I slept on my sides, making falling asleep more difficult. I often awoke to find that I'd removed the mask whilst sleeping. I'd put it back on and awake to find that I'd taken it off again.In short, if you want a mask that will block out most, if not all, light and will last, this is it. It even comes with a small netted bag for you to was the mask in, which is rather convenient since the eyelets would come off during wash cycles. However, if you want something really comfortable, look elsewhere."
'4'.'0',Not really for side sleepers,"This is a great eye mask, but its a little uncomfortable for side sleepers. The round part of the eyes hits my pillow too much. I tried moving the eye pieces more inwards but it didnt help much. A bit of light does slip through in the morning after moving around all night, which creates gap under my eyes, but its not too bad."
'4'.'0',Great and well,"Im a back sleeper and have tried several masks. This mask is very durable, soft to the touch, and comfortable around the eyes. I appreciate how easy it is to adjust the eye pads to match your face. Ive had mine for months now and its still in just as good of condition as the day I bought it, which is something Ive struggled with for other masks. Most other masks usually started falling apart after several trips through the washer, this one holds up well.I will agree with other reviews that state that the back of the head could be more comfortable, but that really hasnt been an issue for me and was something I just got used to. I would also agree that its not a design that suits people who sleep in any other position other than their back, as it becomes awkward and doesnt sit well anymore. But since its very rare that I dont sleep on my back, I love this product.Overall, Ive been very happy with this product and think is youre primarily a back sleeper, this will be a good purchase for you. If you sleep on your side or your face, Id recommend a mask that doesnt have the eye cups and sits more flat on your face so it doesnt move when you lay on your side."
'4'.'0',Comfortable and does a great job blocking light.  Is a bit hot if you are a hot sleeper.,First sleep mask for CPAP that works
'3'.'0',I really love this product but I cannot get it to stay on my face all night. My eye gets smushed by it and then I have blurry vision out of one eye the next day .,The fit was awkward. I put too much effort in to make it just right only to roll over and have to adjust it again. Maybe I would have a better experience if I just stuck it out but once I found my usual one I let it go.
'3'.'0',"If you need a sleep mask to sleep, I could recommend these, but apparently I just wanted to waste 30 bucks to try them out. They are super comfy, but I sleep better not wearing them. My pair will be completely relegated to travel use.",The original was better
'3'.'0',Had the original version and loved it,"5 star idea, 2 star execution."
'3'.'0',"5 star idea, 2 star execution. I saw lots of targeted ads for this and it looked like a really good idea, but the product isn't made very well at all and the material is rough and uncomfortable. The Velcro eyes are hard to position right and it's just not conformable, it just seems not made well. It's pretty expensive and I wish it was better.",Not comfortable while side sleeping
'3'.'0',"While side sleeping, the eye well rims actually push against your eye and face, making it very uncomfortable. For back sleepers this may work just fine.","Well made, fits well, but the bulkiness makes it hard to stay on properly when sleeping on my side"
'3'.'0',"Its a quality product and if I slept on my back it would be my favorite sleep mask, but I dont. When Im on my side and my face is in my pillow it slips enough to no longer fit properly (and sometimes significantly). I tried adjusting the strap but the only way for me to prevent this was to make it too tight. Its a shame because I really wanted to love this mask, and its not cheap! Im back to using one that cost $7.","I like this product especially for it's comfort as long as I'm sleeping on my back.  It's not as comfortable when I sleep on my side.  The eye pads are thick and comfy; but, they are a little too bulky when on my side."
'3'.'0',Mask shifts if youre a side sleeper. Needs to cover more of eye socket.,Not total blackout unless you tighten it more than others. A bit bulky.
'5'.'0',Uninterrupted sleep achieved,"This mask is very comfortable, adjustable, and doesnt squish my eyes. I like that the eye cups can be moved around to cater to the individual face shape. It took me a couple of days to get the adjustments correct but now that I have that dialed in its not slipping off at night at all. When this mask wears out Ill be purchasing another. I do foresee the velcro wearing out before the mask though. When/if this happens Ill just stitch some new velcro to the straps."
'5'.'0',Best sleep mask on the market!,"I've gotten lazy about writing reviews. However this product is so fantastic I must. It's worth telling others. Finally a soft, comfortable mask that doesn't put any pressure on your eyes!  Instead the super soft eye cups protect your precious peepers!  Ladies that invest in lashes. These cups over your eyes leave plenty of room for fake lashes that will still look amazing in the morning ?'?. I love they're washable. I've already put them through once and no pilling or falling apart. I saw these on a YouTube channel called Flora & Note.  They do a food travel show. On one episode they were showing off these masks they love when traveling ( especially planes). It's 100% blackout. I don't get any side light. Perfect darkness.  I know the cups look like they sit high off your face. It's all comfy.  Husband loved mine so much he got a pair as well. Two thumbs up?'??'?"
'5'.'0',?'??'??'? You Need This ?'??'??'?,"Perhaps you think a less expensive type of mask will work. Hell, maybe you think you don't need a mask at all to sleep.I'm here to tell you that you're wrong.Would you pay $30 for one months worth of better sleep? How about $0.50 a night? $0.25? Because that's what's going to happen. The longer you use this mask, the less expensive the investment.I bought this mask a month ago, after having just purchased a different mask. I've only worn the manta mask since I purchased them both. And I've only woken up once in the night. All month long. And that was only because I had to pee.This mask cradles your face in a soft snuggle. Everything is adjustable, so it will fit your face just right. This has not one square inch of Velcro, so it will not snag your hair or your linens, and it will not scratch your face. The eye cups are adjustable, so they are floating precisely over your eyes without pressing on them. Everything is washable, so no grossness near your eyes. It comes with a case/laundry bag. Make sure you inspect all the pockets, because surprise! there is a pair of the best fitting, incredibly quieting ear plugs. They knocked out about 90% of the fireworks and 100% of my neighbors' arguments, which has really been impeding my ability to sleep.Other options are available, like a weighted mask, cooling or warming eye cups, aromatherapy, and a whole line of things that will make you sleep like a cat in the sun. I'm also getting a weighted headband and a body pillow (I'm a side sleeper). The great news is I don't need to buy new eye cups. When building your dossier of manta products, you only need to purchase what you need since everything magically (without any Velcro) attaches and detaches from the mask.Today, I'm going to live my life because I got amazing sleep with my manta eye mask."
'5'.'0',Better sleep than Ive had in a while...,"I am a sensitive sleeper, primarily with regard to light in my eyes when Im trying to sleep. This sleep mask has consistently delivered a quality blackout experience since I started using it a few weeks ago. I like the eye cups because I can reposition them as needed and the hollow area relieves the eye pressure most sleep masks cause. The quality of the fabric is great, very soft, and the headband is adjustable and comfortable - something I struggle with because I have sensitive skin. Overall, its a great addition to my sleep routine - so much so that Ive slept through my alarm a couple of times, just because I was so comfortable and deeply asleep in the dark :)Oh, a note for side or stomach sleepers (I sleep in the freefall position): I have no issues with light leaking on either my side or my stomach sleeping positions. Ive read other reviews that mention issues with these particular positions, but Ive had no problems."
'5'.'0',Best sleep mask ever!,"I have been using sleep masks for about 10 years. I always search for something comfortable with full blackout capabilities. I have to look no further. I use a CPAP at night with a ResMed N30i nasal mask and this sleep mask still fits.I felt it was a bit pricey. But I have issues with my eyelashes not growing straight out anymore. I thought it may be because my old masks would rub on my face during the night. It was worth the lil but extra for the max cushions to ensure when I moved around my lashes would be ok. I have been using this mask for about two weeks now. I feel as though that issue is almost nonexistent if not completely resolved. I brush my lashes everyday and I believe I have begun to notice them getting back to normal.Even if you do not feel like you need the max version, this brand is still the best since the eye cushions are adjustable. I will probably never look for another brand again. I just hope the Velcro holds up since I prefer adjustable straps with a buckle."
'5'.'0',"Soft, comfortable, blocks out light","Ive found the perfect sleep mask. I honestly was very hesitant to spend the money on it, as I had tried other brands and had little satisfaction. But with those cheaper ones light was still getting in and if I tried to adjust it to block out the light it put dangerous and uncomfortable pressure on my eyes. I kept seeing ads for these things, because your phone knows everything about you, so after about 7 months or so, I bit the bullet. I figured buying it from Amazon would allow me to return it should it not fit right. Im an adult with a pretty tiny head. Like, I have to wear kids glasses frames & kids face masks, tiny. Its very hard to find things that fit properly. But this adjusts small enough for my small head. It also allows you to move the eye pieces to make sure your eyes are cupped perfectly.  It puts zero pressure on your eyes as well. I just bought a second one through the companies website and Im looking at getting a third.  I like to have back hps of things I really like and that fit right because you never know when or if they will go out of production. Plus, I travel a lot and its nice to know I can grab one and go without worrying about trying to find it in my bag as soon as I get home because Im tired after a long drive. The material is so soft. Its just the most comfortable sleep mask Ive ever tried."
'5'.'0',Wound sleep without this mask,"I love this mask. It's really comfortable on my face and doesn't feel like I'm wearing a restrictive mask over my eyes. The cushions which go around the eyes are really comfortable to wear. Other masks I've worn over the years gave me a headache when I woke up in the morning. This one doesn't even feel like it's on my face! Because I work night shift, this mask is a requirement for me to sleep in the day. Absolutely ZERO light comes into the mask, allowing me to get 'night time?? sleep. I've also used it while flying, and it's amazing for this application too! I will never buy another sleeping mask again!"
'5'.'0',I was transported into a new dimension and woke up not knowing what year it was,"I slipped this bad boy on and fell into a sleep so deep and so sound that I woke up panicked, completely sure that I had slept through a very important exam... only to remember - wait, no - I am 31 years old, nearly a decade out of school, and I no longer have to take exams.  This sleep mask has literally taken years off of my life.  The cups are soft foam and completely block out all light, yet theyre raised enough so I feel like the eyelashes that I pay way too much money for are free to flutter around unobstructed when Im deep in a REM cycle.  I also have my Manta mask tightened ever so slightly to give just the tiniest bit of pressure... like a little Sleep Fairy is giving my face a delicate little hug.... and this has helped me to relax my forehead muscles and has reduced my tension headaches.  For that effect alone, I feel like buying another pair, cutting out the eye holes, and just wrapping the strap against my head Ninja-Turtle style during the day to combat migraines.I bought the thin strap because it completely overloads my senses to have my ears covered while Im sleeping; I find this strap to be perfect in that it secures the mask to my head while not being overly intrusive or uncomfortable.  As far as aesthetics go.... my boyfriend probably doesnt love sleeping next to a bug-eyed fly at night.  But it doesnt really matter because when I have my Manta mask on, I cant see his face to know whether or not he grimaces at the sight of me.  And if he does grimace, too bad because Ill be asleep in 2 minutes flat, dreaming of a guy who has a thing for girls in Manta Masks."
'5'.'0',Use every night! Super cozy,"100% blackout, but slips off"
'4'.'0',For Back Sleepers Only,"These aren't comfortable if you sleep on your side or belly. The pads under the eyes keep the light out, but they're a little stiff and push into your face, causing pain and pressure."
'4'.'0',No carrying case but awesome mask,This mask is the best on the market. This is my second time purchasing Manta and I would've given it 5 stars but considering my last mask came with a carry pouch for storing it and this time it didn't I had to deduct a star.
'4'.'0',Leaves mark around your eyes,"I found these extremely comfortable to sleep with and then I looked into the mirror in the morning and fainted. Just short of black eyes! The eye pieces try to fit well--and I am sure if you are a back sleeper they will be just perfect. However, it you sleep on your side, or God forbid, on your stomach, you are not able to show your face for a couple of hours after waking."
'4'.'0',I am kind of on the fence about this sleep mask after a couple months of use. It is definitely bulky for side,I wish this would have stayed on my face but it always slides off. It was soft and comfortable and didn't put pressure on my eyes. But I must pull it off when I sleep or move too much or something. It didn't help unfortunately. And it doesn't fit well with a CPAP mask.
'4'.'0',"Very comfortable, but not for side sleepers","This mask is high quality, and blocks out 100% of light. Its adjustable and super soft. However, as a side-sleeper, the the weight of your head seems to create a pressure point on outside of your eye socket, cause by the eye ""cups"". This gets pretty uncomfortable after a while. This mask is the best light-blocking mask Ive experienced, at the cost of side sleeping."
'4'.'0',A little over,"I found this product to be a little over-hyped. Take it for what it is - a sleeping mask. It is not some magic remedy for poor sleep. Its for keeping light out, nothing more. If you struggle to fall asleep due to sound or your mind not switching off, this wont fix that.However, they are extremely comfortable and once you find the right fit, they completely block out ALL light. So if you are buying it for that reason alone, there is no better option."
'4'.'0',"Seems like a perfectly fine sleep mask, plenty of room in the eye cups to keep pressure off your eyes and when fit snugly blocks out all light.  Had never used a sleep mask before and find this one to be uncomfortable for me as a side sleeper.","Asian noise, high cheek bones, not so good. Ear doesnt hurt though"
'4'.'0',"Puts pressure on my sinuses. Had to adjust eye cups slightly.  I sew and am crafty, so easy for me to do. Im used to it.  I have to adjust anything I  wear.Very soft, stays put.Best thing is,  usually my ears hurt because Im a side sleeper. Wakes me up. The straps are cushy though and protects my ears",Great comfy but no 100% blackout
'2'.'0',"Comfy, but only while sleeping on your back","The item itself is pretty comfy but the one major downfall is it limits you to one sleeping position. The cups press into your eyes when you lay on your side or stomach ( if you wear glasses you know the feel). I figured that maybe taking the cups off the mask might help to alleviate that, but the nose bridge part is too small and it wont fit right, allowing light in."
'2'.'0',"No matter how tight or how I position this mask, it slides off during the night. A waste of money.",Wanted to love this...
'2'.'0',"Wanted to love this, due to innovation of its design.  Alas, one size doesnt fit all, or at least does not fit eyelashes.  Also,  the mask proved unsuitable for side sleepers or stomach sleepers, incompatible with several pillows, and prone to falling off and/or waking one up during tossing/turning.","Although the cups on your eyes are very soft and comfortable, the lack of elastic in the band lead to slipping and sliding throughout the night. You might think youve velcroed it tightly, but if you have any hair or if you move at all throughout the night, it will not stay in place. This makes it useless for most people. I bought a better one for under a third of the price ($6.99 from MIZO) - the adjustable ELASTIC strap changes everything."
'2'.'0',Really dont care for these,"Less comfortable than a standard eye masks, fall off of my head during the night so I wake up when the light comes in, which was the whole reason I got this mask.Positions itself as a premium product at a premium price-point but doesnt deliver."
'2'.'0',"The fabric was very rough, especially for the eye area. The band that goes around the head was thick and uncomfortable.","I use a sleepmask every night because im very sensitive to light. I have used cheaps masks for years, and decided to give this one a shot.In order for this to cover both of my eyes, I have to wear the mask fairly tight, which makes it completely uncomfortable. After trying this out for a couple of nights, I have gone back to my old $10 mask.I would not recommend this based on my experience."
'2'.'0',This product is very soft and blocks all light. It is not comfortable when sleeping on side. I could not fall asleep.  No issues If you can sleep on your back.,Bummer for side sleepers
'2'.'0',So this mask is not good for side sleepers in my opinion. It gave me a headache with its 'bulk?? around the eyes. If I was a back sleeper I think this product would be great! When I laid on my back it kept the light out. Very soft and it seemed like it was made well and material was soft. Just to bulky around my eyes for side sleeping. So I must return it sadly.,"Seems used,thought was new"
'3'.'0',Not worth the pricetag,"This is a tough one to review. Ive had these for a little over a month now and every night Im trying to figure out whether I like it or not.First off, it is pretty comfortable but not all the time. As soon as you roll over to the side the eye foam cups start being pushed into the corners of your eyes. Every single night I find myself adjusting the eye cups at least 3-5 times before falling asleep. I actually think this cupping system they have going here is the biggest flaw because its always shifting around.I much rather prefer my gfs $5 sleep mask which has a thick border between my eyes and the mask so my eyelashes dont touch it.This mask is probably good for those that dont move around or just sleep on their backs.Not worth the $35 in my opinion"
'3'.'0',Not for side sleepers,"Quality is good, shipped fast, just not what I thought it would be for the price. If you are a side sleeper this is NOT for you."
'3'.'0',I'm a rotisserie chicken sleeper and these are just not good for anything but back sleeping. They buckle and the bulk of the cups aren't really that pillowy. I've tried every adjustment possible. I was so sad. I'd been looking at them for years.Good for migraines and overstimulation though.,not great for side sleeping
'3'.'0',"Im a side sleeper, and I find that the mask pushes into my eye socket, and its difficult to find a comfortable position to use it.  Because its jammed into my eye, it squishes the mask and light gets in.  I dont care how I adjust it (and it does have a lot of adjustability), it lets in light and jabs my eye because it protrudes so much.  Looking for another one that will do a better job.","This is certainly a well-made product and relatively versatile with the adjustable eye pads. However, I found my face got just too warm at night. It would also be nice if there were a product made that was thinner and more breathable. Of course, this is my personal preference."
'3'.'0',"After about 6 months of nightly use, the velcro in the back stopped working. Relatively comfortable and completely black","My husband and I are traveling to a destination that has 24 hours of sunlight so we purchased this product. While these work for my husband, they unfortunately were not for me. While I could not see any light, I found these very uncomfortable when sleeping on my side. They created a lot of pressure and discomfort on my cheek bones."
'3'.'0',"Great for darkening, hard to use for sleep","To be fair, these are comfortable and do an excellent job of delivering complete darkness. With the foam eye rings, which are adjustable, you get a very good result IF you're only laying on your back.I found that when trying to sleep on my side or stomach it was nearly impossible to keep them on correctly. The foam creates an extension away from your face and is easily moved if you'rea stomach sleeper. It also created uncomfortable pressure on my eyes when laying in a position that had either eye on my pillow.Again, great for a back sleeper or if you're looking for completely darkness but not ideal for side or stomach sleep."
'3'.'0',They changed the straps,I bought a new one to replace my old one and the straps are different and I find the new straps make it harder to adjust for fitting ?'?
'3'.'0',Went back to my old mask after trying these.,They are soft but really mediocre. Dont Like them. Went back to my old one. Way over engineered  I want function not style in a sleep mask.
'4'.'0',Not as good as my old version,"Before you could buy it on Amazon, I got it direct from manufacturer. Years later, I find the quality to be not quite as good. It still works just fine. Better than competition, thats for sure. Its just that something is off about it, but not sure what."
'4'.'0',necessary tool if you have thyroid eye disease,"I was advised by my doctor to buy a cupped eye mask for my thyroid eye disease. my lids would not fully close at night when sleeping so i would wake up with dry, crusty, painful eyes and frequent styes. i got this mask, and another mask with a flatter cup, shortly after getting punctal plugs installed in my tear ducts. i have to say that the masks function just as effectively, if not more so, than the punctal plugs. my punctal plugs fell out so i can compare mask use both with and without the plugs, and can safely say the mask does most of the work. i cant sleep without the masks. if i do, or if they come off at night, then i wake up with my eyes feeling absolutely butchered. i cant believe i didnt buy this sooner. if you have thyroid eye disease then dont hesitate - buy this mask (or any other cupped eye mask). i like that the eye cups are removable and adjustable with velcro, and the head strap is also velcro adjustable. for the most part, it is comfortable and completely blocks light. my eyes are not nearly as dry as they use to be upon waking up. i cant sleep without it now.i will go into the cons now - for this particular model, i found that the cup padding would press into my sinus/nose bridge and could interfere with breathing comfort a little. but the trade off is worth it. on days when i feel extra sensitive, or more asthmatic, and it bothers me too much, then i will switch out this mask for a more lightweight model. sometimes the mask comes off my face at night and i am not sure if its me pushing it off, or it coming off by itself. sometimes it does get a little warm, so maybe unknowingly, in my sleep, i end up pushing it off. i often rotate between this eye mask, and the ones with less defined eye cups. but having the eye cup is key as a flat, standard mask wont cut it. if you are a side sleeper, then the cups might end up being pushed around a bit, especially if you move around a lot when you sleep.whether you choose this particular model or another one i am sure you will find relief. totally worth the money, cheaper than punctal plugs, and works just as well, if not better, than the punctal plugs. keeps my eyes from drying out completely in my sleep and it improves my sleep quality. even though my ted has improved with medication i will still continue to sleep with this mask on, especially in winter with the heat on causing dryness. sad that this isnt sold in pharmacies or covered by insurance, its truly an eye-saver. love it."
'4'.'0',These were almost perfect,"As eyemasks go, these were nearly perfect. The little eye pockets are adjustable, which allows them to be moved to fit your face better. I loved that! they are soft and do an excellent job blocking out light if you dont have to wear a CPAP mask.Sadly, I needed them to work with my CPAP machine mask (I use a nostril pillow), and I couldnt find a way to adjust the eyes to work properly with my mask straps. I had to return them. I have a small face, so that may be the problem for me, personally. I had to return these. They just didnt work with my mask and my face."
'4'.'0',"The Manta Sleep Mask is a reliable choice for blocking out light, earning a solid 4",Blocks light well for back sleepers
'4'.'0',"Very good quality and blocks light really well when Im on my back, but unfortunately Im a side sleeper. The eye cups are very firm and square",Pretty Good if you can stomach the price!
'4'.'0',"Ive been using this for a month. Ive got pretty significant dry eyes.  And I sleep a lot on my side or even stomach, sometimes poking my eyes or putting pressure on them.This helped a lot. First, it essentially prevents you from stomach sleeping very much as that usually knocks it off.  The first few nights I would wake up and not even be able to find the mask.Then, with slide sleeping its a little better. I still wake up with the mask pushed off my eyes at least once a night though.But most of the time, it works pretty well. Over time I spend more time sleeping on my back or at sort of a slightly less angle then on the side, and the mask stays on a little more every night.And it does help with dry eyes.  Not totally of course but somewhat helpful.The price is ridiculous.  Its less than a dollars of some overseas material.  I expect that will plummet as more clones appear.  But for now its pretty good.  It is hard to adjust the velcro to get the eye cups just right but then it stays like that.",Deep sockets are nice
'4'.'0',Great: The deeper eye sockets are nice. I have long eyelashes and other well,To block light and wind out. It's also super nice to be able to adjust the position of the pads to cover directly where your eyes are if they happen to be offset when you get them (simple peel off and apply Velcro function)I'd recommend this to people who like sleep masks or feel the need for one.
'4'.'0',Material is comfy but design doesnt consider all uses,"The material for this is definitely comfortable and while it is true that this mask can cover practically any peaking light, this is achievable only with a certain fit. This is something Id probably more so recommend to someone whos on a flight or traveling as this is not exactly the most comfortable-fitting mask when you wear it to actually block all light from peaking. As someone else mentioned, you basically have to wear this tight enough for the mask to actually fit well enough to cover your particular contour which only then allows the mask to do its job'at which point it is no longer comfy to wear. Otherwise its not different than any other $5 sleep mask. This kind of requirement is why I would recommend this for someone on a plane who isnt really being guaranteed any place of comfort and would actually reap the most benefit from this design. There is a trick I have discovered when wearing this in bed where I have managed to adjust the coverage of the mask by wearing it barely tight and making sure the band is not actually going below the ears. I can do this on most nights and if I keep my head still, the mask will kind of get tugged from being squished between my head and my pillow and will kind of force itself down from the actual mask part. This is arguably the only way Ive been able to sleep comfortably with this thing but it is something I found out by really struggling with it for a month or so. The only reason this is not lower than 4 stars is because as stated before, this particular mask is manufactured pretty well and the material is comfortable albeit probably not so much in the warmer seasons/climates. This mask IS washer friendly as Ive washed it several times and it has not lost its shape. Basically, the mask is the closest any producer can get to achieving pitch black sleep while maintaining max comfort. Unless you dont mind having a tight mask to get guaranteed pitch black sleep, this is for you. Otherwise, Id cut your losses and put up with a cheaper mask that will pretty much give you the same coverage for the same comfort/lower price."
'4'.'0',Let there be darkness!,"The mask does work well for blocking out light. Love the movable eye pieces to get a personalized fit. The eye cushions are a little uncomfortable if you are a side sleeper because they can cause pressure points depending on how you lay on them. However, it's the best mask I've found so far."
'4'.'0',Second Best Eye Mask for CPAP Users,"The best eye mask for cpap users is EyeEco, but it looks goofy.  It took about 2 weeks to break this in and find the right position with my cpap. The eye pads and my mask still bump into each other at times, but it works. This is probably best for people with taller faces so the mask doesnt hit the cpap."
'4'.'0',Note to side sleepers,If your a side sleeper. I would recommend getting the slim version of this. Even though this says its good for side sleepers. It is very comfortable.
'4'.'0',I got these to block out light from my window and it's pitch black in these things. I can fully open my eyes as still see nothing. Not the best for side sleeping because it can press the eye a little bit but once you find that sweet spot good sleep is imminent.,"I got the eye mask because I am a side sleeper and wear false lashes. The mask is deep enough so that it doesn't touch my lashes. For the most part, it keeps my lashes intact when I sleep except if I move the mask in my sleep."
'4'.'0',Don't like the Velcro bump in the back,The mask is great and definitely keeps the light out. The down side is I'm a back sleeper and the Velcro strap in the back is annoying as your head rests on that part of the strap. It would be great if the back of the strap was wider to displace the impact of the Velcro bump.
'4'.'0',Not really for sleeping,This definitely blocks out all light but I think it would be better if you were on a bus or plane and wanted to catch a nap. The pads are so thick and stiff that it makes any sort of side sleeping impossible.
'4'.'0',Great Blackout Eye Mask,"Not the most comfortable mask Ive found for side sleepers, but overall best Ive tried so far. The adjustable cups make it easy to fit the mask to any face, and it blocks out light like a champ. Only downaide is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting to get them comfortable when sleeping on your side. They stay on your head better than most masks as well. Would recommend."
'4'.'0',"Similar to one I have which was no longer available, I gave this to my son in law as a gift. Uses it, loves it, never knew what he had been missing out on. Came fast and in perfect condition.",Not so great for big heads
'2'.'0',"I got this from a deal on ""The View"" hoping it would put some weight on my eyes for relaxation. There is barely any weight and Im pretty disappointed to have something I paid for that I will be discarding.",?
'4'.'0',I've been on a mission to find a sleep mask that I like. I saw this in an article and didn't do a lot of research. I was surprised that it is just one strip. That said when I found the loop hole on the end it made all the difference in the world. I love this thing. It stays in place while I sleep.,I love the quality of this sleep mask. So comfortable and actually works for a good nights rest!
'4'.'0',"Love this product.  Although it has a small button hole in the back, there was no actual button.  The 1st week I just laid it over my eyes, but of course when you turn over it falls off.  So I added a button and it stayed on perfectly after that!",Sometimes I wish it didnt have so many weighted pods - but overall I like it
'4'.'0',Sometimes I wish it didnt have so many weighted pods,"Very comfortable, hard to stay on"
'4'.'0',"I dont like the tension of normal eye masks that use an elastic band, these are easy to fall asleep in because they are so comfortable, but obviously they shift and fall off during the night.  if you only need a mask to fall asleep (not stay asleep) I would recommend.",Comfortable Sleep-Aid
'4'.'0',I use this often and have no issue with the comfort. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is that it does not completely block out light. It might be due to the orange color I ordered. Perhaps a darker color would be better.,Love but not as heavy as I would like.
'4'.'0',"I wish they were a little heavier, I like the pressure of having my arm over my eyes and this isn't that, it's much less. Otherwise I really like them. The cool side is actually cool too!","Great product, awkward packaging..."
'4'.'0',"This seems like a super great product, but the instruction packet and the box itself have sexual insinuations on them. Taglines like ""before we sleep together..."", ""cant wait to sleep with you"", and ""dont worry, Ill fit""","Loved this item, I do think it would work best for folks who sleep on thier back though, Im a fidgety side-sleeper so it kept needing adjustment. Very good weight and lovely soft feel too, would recommended trying"
'4'.'0',"I like it but it tends to feel heavy on my eyelids, which is purposeful. Meh.","I was actually surprised by how light this mask is and thought it was funny that there are some reviewers who found it to heavy. I had a very heavy mask prior and wouldnt mind if this one had more weight. Regardless, this mask is very comfortable. I love the loop hole design in the back. It is not lumpy and doesnt catch your hair the way Velcro straps do. I love the length. It feels like my head and eyes are being given a fuzzy hug. Came nicely packaged as well."
'4'.'0',Not heavy enough and too small to go around my head,Not heavy enough for me and why is there no button to close it?I pulled the fabric through the hole but then it was too small to go down over my ears where I need it.
'4'.'0',Comfortable but just another sleep mask,"Its a decent product, seems to be made well. Comfortable, soft. I just dont get it. I love my weighted blanket, I feel secure and sleep better. But the nodpod pillow weighted blanket for your eyes thing has no effect on me.Its like a normal sleep mask, as mentioned before its comfortable but isnt completely dark as you shift around if that matters to you. 4 stare for being a decent product but no difference in sleep quality."
'4'.'0',Remove some of the beads and youll be golden!,"There are 4 sections of micro beads in this nodpod. The middle two are over your eyes and the outer two cover your ears if you wrap it and secure it around your head, which is want I wanted to do.  The pressure from the two middle sections on the eyes were great, but as a side sleeper, the beads in those outer sections were surprisingly hard against my ears making it completely uncomfortable and impossible to sleep with.  So, I used a seam ripper and took out the beads in the two outer sections.  Now, I can wrap it around my head and my ears are covered but without the hard beads. It doesnt block out sound, but that wasnt an issue for me.  I suppose you could refill it with polyfil or something to provide softness with a sound barrier.  Hope this helps!"
'4'.'0',"Best on the market, wish it was heavier","I really wish I could find this construction but closer to a full pound of weight. Its the only one Ive tried (I returned two back to Amazon before getting this one) that rests nicely on my face, stays in place, doesnt get stuck with my curly hair & hook n loops, doesnt press into my nose causing me to feel suffocated.The material is super soft and the pockets arent so packed tight like some other brands so it drapes easy and doesnt cause weird pressure points."
'4'.'0',"I love nod pod, I have like 5 of them and can't sleep without it. The only thing is I ordered this purple one and it wasn't sewn correctly and the little beads in it goes all in one pocket so it isn't evenly spread out anymore. Unfortunately it makes it unusable because it's lumpy. All my others ones work though so I think it was just an issues with the sewing on this one.",Perfect for what I needed
'4'.'0',"The mask is a little lighter than I expected, I have to manipulate the beads to keep the weight on my eye sockets, otherwise the length of the mask shifts the weight across the head .My doctor wanted me to sleep with weighted eye mask to keep my eyelids closed as Im experiencing dry eye.  Its comfortable, and stays in place if i stay on my back. If I roll on my side it initially stays in place, but if I awake on my side it has slipped off.  I like the fact that I dont need a band around my head but It can be comfortably attached if you want. It cant be heated or chilled, so I must use another mask for warm/cold compresses.",Could be a bit heavier
'4'.'0',"I often sleep with my arm over my eyes, so I figured I would try this instead. Pros: I liked the material used (it is cool on the side that you place against your eyes, which turned out to be a very nice feature). Cons: It actually isnt heavy enough for me. I wish they had put more microbeads in it. I can get a slightly better effect by moving all the beads to sit directly above my eyes, but it could still be heavier. You also have to sleep on your back and it will fall off if you roll. There is no way to secure it to your head. Will look for some microbead long stuffed animal","I originally got this for my migraines, but have been using this at night when I sleep as well. I keep it looped and just slip it over my head then tighten it and it seems to work fine that way. The beads do tend to go one way if I lay that way, but I really just like this for how well it blocks any and all light out. I don't ever wake up in the middle of the night anymore. I get the best sleep with this mask on, especially when I have anxiety. I have only had one migraine since getting this and it seemed to work pretty well for it too! I definitely recommend it to everyone!!"

'4'.'0',"I like this sleeping aid. It is comfortable, once you get it on properly. However, it does bunch up a bit in the back, so I didnt give it the highest rating. I do believe though that I am getting a better, deeper sleep using this.",I wouldn't call it weighted
'4'.'0',"The mask is fine, however it has like beads inside so it's not 'weighted?? feels like a bean bag. So I would call it a weighted eyemask. I wish it was heavier on my face.",I can read late at night now without hubby complaining
'4'.'0',I bought this for my husband who struggles some nights when Im reading later than he is.  He finds the NodPod quite relaxing but a little bit warm on the face.  I suggested he use the other side; maybe the sides are different for that reason.,Helpful for falling asleep
'4'.'0',"Helpful for falling asleep, works its way down over the course of the night","Best sleep my husband has had in ages.  The first night, he actually overslept.  My only complaint was that I order it in the grey color and was sent bright pink which was not the best"
'5'.'0',Dont use my eye mask anymore,"I always use an eye mask, shirt, or something else to cover my eyes at night. Ive tried those eye masks with beads or gel in them but they always seem to smell weird or be uncomfortable. I love my weighted blanket and love this item just as much. I didnt know I need it until I saw it and tried it and I cant imagine going without it now. Its just the right amount of weight, its easy to position and it works weight Im lying on my back or on my side. I was skeptical of the design (it doesnt wrap around your head) until I tried it. Its more comfortable tbh than the traditional mask straps that go around your head.If you like eye masks and/or weighted blankets this is awesome."
'5'.'0',perfect weight and coverage,Perfect for naps to block light .  The weight feels comforting on the eyes without pushing too hard.  Soft and pliable to get exactly as you want it.  I love this!
'5'.'0',"Have tried numerous night masks ,ending up with my hair on the back of my head breaking.This mask although a lot pricey was worth the purchase. I constantly change positions and it seems to stay on with out any elastic or Velcro closures allowing fir a good night's sleep.","I am a snob when it comes to sleeping with eye masks. I cannot fall asleep with any light and have been sleeping with a mask for years. Nothing comes close to this one, it is hands down the best, most comfortable total light blocker and I cannot live without it now that I've tried it. I've never slept so well!I've tried every type and every brand of eye masks and I hate the elastic bands and the fact there is always light leaking through somewhere. Eventually I settled on old cut up shirts over my eyes. Which is actually quite similar to this but the bean bags allow it to comfortably settle on my eye blocking ALL light!!!I thought it was a bit pricey but now that I've been using it, it's worth way more to me than what I paid for.I'm beyond happy to find this eye mask!"
'5'.'0',"This eye mask is worth every penny! The weight is just perfect to keep my eyes relaxed and shut. The cooling fabric on one side keeps me from getting the ""sticky eyes"" from moisture and sweating, and I love the length so you can tighten it around your head or let it lay loose and still be able to roll from side to side.  Last but not least, the introduction booklet that comes with the packaging is fun and witty. This has quickly become a beloved staple. I will be purchasing more of these for friends, family and self!",Literally an answer to years of bad sleep
'5'.'0',"Ive been working 3rd shift for about 4 years now.. Lately Ive been having issues sleeping and so I figured the room was too bright and started looking into eye masks. Now the issue I kept struggling with is I do move in my sleep and I dont want to feel ""trapped"" with an eye mask on my head if that makes sense. I like that this one lays on your face and is semi weighted with beads to stay in place and provide some benefits of weighted relief. Now it doesnt stay on your face all of your sleeping time obviously however there is a hole where you can play a corner in to affix it to your head. I like that it helps me sleep and if I wake up later its next to me ready to place on my face again. The jersey side is my favorite side the other side is a fuzzy soft material my husband likes (yup bought him one too because he stole mine while sleeping one night) you can even FREEZE this lovely thing for headache days oh my goodness. (CANNOT heat this item due to the beads) I love literally love this sleep mask it really has helped treat this horrible bout of unable to sleep and stay asleep issues Ive been having.",Don't question the design- it's unique but worth it!
'5'.'0',"I've slept with a satin eye mask for past year and always annoyed when I would wake up and it slide off my head and it's so tiny I could never find it in middle of night. The nodpod has really been amazing, at first I was skeptical like how it doesn't go around your head. But after reading instructions on when you're on your side how to place it vs back, I'm obsessed!! The gentle pressure really helps put me to sleep. And then in middle of night if I wake up and it's off me (I move a lot in my sleep) because of it's shape it's so easy to find vs a small regular eye mask. Also it's so cozy sometimes I wake up finding myself cuddling it like a stuffed animal haha. I love it and def gonna buy a second one for my husband !",Literally the best thing that ever happened to my sleep routine.
'5'.'0',Perfect weight,"Love this thing, few suggestions"
'5'.'0',"I love this nodpod, I use it every night! I do wish I had the option of one that is even lighter because sometimes when it is resting against my eyeballs it can be uncomfortable. The shape of the little pouches can be smoothed over your face so it's less uncomfortable, but sometimes the beads shift so they're like all in your eye sockets and weighing them down. So maybe if the little sections were even flatter? Obviously it takes a few tries to figure out how it is comfortable but I still love it","I honestly feel like since getting this, I fall asleep much faster. The gentle pressure on my eyes must signal to my brain that its night-night time. I tend to shift to my side throughout the night and sometimes it does fall off, but its not too big a deal for me. My bedroom gets extremely bright in the morning and it blocks out all of that light. I recommend! The duo sided textures are also a nice feature."
'5'.'0',"I didnt realize this was a weighted sleep mask when I got it. I thought it was some gel or memory foam maybe. Wasnt interested or in the market for a weighted mask at all. But since I had it, I figured why not give it a try. Well turns out I really like this thing. I think it does actually help me fall asleep believe it or not. It definitely blocks out all light once its on. And you could use it on trips or a plane if you wanted, because of the ability to tie it. Although I think its kind of heavy to be traveling with in my personal opinon. I find a cheaper silk mask is still best for that situation. But all in all I ended up loving this thing even though I honestly didnt realize what it was. And quite frankly I was kind of skeptical when I tried it. I really was just going to return it and buy one of the other well rated non weighted masks. Glad I decided to give it a try.I definitely suggest you give this a try. The material is soft and two sided if you prefer a cooler side. Its adjusts to your sleep style. And it has a few color options. Its a bit on the expensive side in comparison to other sleep masks but then again they arent weight and they cant be put in the freezer and double as a cooling pack. So Id actually say the value is pretty good value for a weighted mask. I will admit though that I dont think this will be for everyone. Some people will probably just never like the feeling of the weight on their face, but that doesnt mean you shouldnt give it a shot for a night and test to see. Its not like it costs hundreds of dollars to try.",Surprisingly comfortable
'5'.'0',"I've tried a few traditional eye masks in the past, but none fit the bill. The headband",Best sleep I ever got
'5'.'0',"LOVE. Only downside is when you forget to pack her. Don't forget she is machine washable, will break you out if you aren't washing enough",This is fantastic for sleeping.  I love the softer side
'5'.'0',ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL !!!!,"I thought this would be a scam or a social media fad, but was delightfully shocked at how wrong I was. To preface, I have struggled with insomnia and ptsd for many years and have since struggled to find a sleep remedy. I am prescribed sleep meds, drink tea before bed, etc etc and have not found anything COMPARABLE to the sleepnod sleep mask. This actually does make a significant difference within three minutes and has without a doubt been a 'cure all?? for me. So good that after trying this for only three nights that I purchased another for my roommate. I cannot stress enough how incredibly this works."
'5'.'0',Bussin. The most bussin sleep I have ever gotten.,"My husband loves this sleep mask. He said it has just the right amount of weighted pressure against his eyes, and likes that one side feels a bit cooler than the other. He likes to use the cooler side when he has a headache. He doesnt like to fasten his eye masks. He does not lose this one like the others. Its a little longer than some if the others, and we chose yellow to make it less difficult to lose in the covers. So far, this is a winner!"
'5'.'0',"This thing is a game changer. I thought the closure in the back would be an issue, but its not. Im also a side sleeper most of the time and dont have an issue with it staying on. I will say though, this thing puts me into a deep sleep. I try not to wear it on days when I need to get up early because it blocks out so much light and the weight is so relaxing I cant get up!",Soft Weighted sleep mask
'5'.'0',Best sleep mask out there! I've tried lots of different eye mask since I move a lot in my sleep and this is the other one I love. Yes it falls off sometimes but overall is very comfortable. Just enough weight for your eyes to fall into a deep sleep. This is my second one and will always be my go to eye mask,"I used to sleep with a pillow over my head yo cover ears and eyes (my oldest son has done the same since the day he was born).  Long enough to cover eyes and ears if you're laying on your back or on your side. These are great, but would be nice if they were a bit less expensive. $35 is a crazy amount for it.  But did I buy 3, yes I did."
'5'.'0',"Tbh I bought this as a gag gift for myself... No way this was going to work as a ""real"" sleep mask, I thought. I love sleep masks and I have quite the collection, from the cheap ones the airline companies give you to the ones with silk and all the gimmicks and designs for light blocking and comfort.I was more interested in the weighted aspect of this one as I once used a weighted blanket and I loved the feeling of calm/security it gives.Well, well, well... the joke is on me! I love this eye patch and will not be without it. It is true that is is easier to use if you are used to sleeping on you back, as it simply doesnt move. I fell asleep without even realizing it the first time I used it, ""just to try"". It blocks out the light even in a bright room.I am, however, a side sleeper and I sleep on both sides. The flat, end tail of the mask makes this very possible and much more confortable than expected. The other pods that are not in use lay on the side of your head and the weight really feels good and relaxing. The only issue, if I must point one out, is that you have to adjust the pods on your eyes if you change sides a lot but now I do this almost automatically without waking up too much. Apparently you can join the ends together somehow but I havent tried that yet.Anyways, I love this thing more than expected and will be getting one for my Dad who shares my ridiculous obsession for eyepatches!",I've had every mask: this is the BEST!
'5'.'0',"I literally have a drawer full of sleeping masks that I've been experimenting with over the last few years. This is by far the greatest sleeping mask I've ever used in my life. My husband sleeps with a black sock over his eyes and has always done that as long as I've known him. I begrudgingly let him use my mask last night, And he wakes up and tells me it was the best mask he's ever used. So now he's going to be buying one as well. I think what really sets this mask apart from all the others is the fact that you don't have to tie it around your head because the weight of the beads makes it stay  Pretty consistently on your face even though I move frequently throughout the night. Also, the beds sink lower into my eyesocket, keeping my eyelids shut with very gentle pressure and prevent any light from entering my husband and I were both concerned that it might be a little hot, but neither one of us noticed any temperature difference between this mask, and our usual apparatus. My only problem with this mask is that they don't have the black color available via prime and I would have to wait for a long time for it. So I have a color I'm not exactly stoked about but damn if this isn't the greatest invention ever!",Cant sleep without it
'5'.'0',"Ive used it every night since it arrived. Helps me fall asleep. Its easy to wash, I toss it in with a load of bedding with similar washing instructions. As a hot sleeper, I love the cool side. The other side is very soft and cozy.",Shocked by amazing results
'5'.'0',"Woah, I'm a late night sleeper and because of my bad habit I never get good sleep. This thing got me sleeping nice and deep. I naturally woke up 6 hours later wearing this to my surprise feeling so rested and ready to wake up. Hopefully it'll help me to change my habit to going to sleep earlier, since it knocks me to sleep pretty fast :)",Warning (SCARY) experience
'5'.'0',"I was so excited to sleep with this mask it's so pretty and it's very soft it also matches the aesthetic of my room. But the first night I got it I slept with it, when I woke up the next morning I had blurred vision like it was so bad I could barely see big objects let alone read anything on my phone. When I tell you how scary this was?? I cried!! After about 2 hours my vision started to go back to normal..and I just had a headache btw I have always had perfect vision like I can read a label from across the room good so I personally won't ever be using this again.it's obviously way to heavy set for eyes and unsafe. I'm considering returning it or taking the beads out but this for almost $40! I was so surprised.. you would think your getting the best quality. But I just thought I would share my terrifying experience so that whoever reads this can be warned and prepared. My vision is back to normal but that's not something worth risking again or playing with.",Must Buy For Troubled Sleepers/Side Sleepers
'5'.'0',"I have always had a hard time falling asleep at night, but this helps me within minutes drift off. I am a side sleeper, so I love that you can place it perfectly on your head/eyes without it bulging behind your head or feeling lumpy. Definitely worth every penny!!!!","I wasnt too sure about it at first, but after having slept several weeks with this eye pillow, its fantastic. Soft, a gentle weight, and it does a good job at blocking light. It does well for the initial fall asleep stage of side sleeping as well. Of course, Im an active sleeper so it does roll off my face, but that doesnt bother me."
'5'.'0',Excellent air circulation.,Simplicity form and function using gravity to creat black out conditions.  Highly recommend it. My head sweats easily and any mask would get too hot or tight or too worn out. Its like a mini blanket for your eyes that stays it place. Now I can sleep in any light conditions knowing I can black out any time. Highly recommend it.?????
'4'.'0',Only concern is that it feels like youre sleeping on a knot. Otherwise the weight distribution is good and I like the coolness of the mask on my eyes.,Satisfied with mask but had to take the seeds out of the left side as I am a side sleeper only.
'4'.'0',Comfortable And soft. Not the best fit,I like the material and the weight of it. The only bad thing is. That it doesn't stay on your head over night.
'4'.'0',"Wish it was heavier, but it is comfortzble.",Slips off as you sleep. Would a little velcro kill anyone?
'4'.'0',It takes some getting used to but it keeps the light out.,Love this mask ... feels good and works great!
'4'.'0',Very nice although hard to adjust,Very soft and comfortable but it loosens up because the fabric tab for holding it together doesnt stay tight.
'4'.'0',"Love this next to any traditional eye mask. I would prefer it to be heavier, but it's good. The one thing I dislike most is that the beads (obviously) shift around due to gravity.. not sure what I expected because I guess they'd all do that, but I just manipulate the beads into the right spot when I get comfy in my bed. Overall I love it & I'd recommend it to anyone",Semi heavy sleep mask.
'4'.'0',Helps me fall asleep neat lil invention,"I bought this initially looking for a weighted eye mask option and although its not very 'heavy??, it does the trick. Stays on all night for me when I hook the ends together. More frequently I rest it on my face and that option totally works too!"

'4'.'0',"Overall, it's a great sleep mask. The only thing I don't like is that it's still slightly too big when I pull it as tight as it will go. The weight is great though! I keep mine in the freezer before use and it's nice and cool as well.","Our family have migraine headaches frequently. I purchased two of these to use specifically for those blinding headaches. We have used many items, including prescriptions, but this is an added comfort item.  It seems like a weird little product but it absolutely helps in easing discomfort"
'4'.'0',Not as heavy as expected,"I really like this. When Im super stressed is nice to just lay down with my eyes closed and having this nod pod on my eyes is very relaxing. I was surprised by its weight. It is not very heavy at all. At first I thought that would make me like it less, but it still makes me feel relaxed"
'4'.'0',"This helps me calm down and actually keep my eyes closed when I have trouble settling to sleep! I actually wish it had a little more weight to help with migraines, and you really have to lie on your back so side sleeping it's not as effective. I would still buy it again though, I'm definitely enjoying it.",Great for headaches and migraines
'4'.'0',Secure but comfortable fastening method,"I have purchased several eye pillows and was surprised to find how effective this one is!  I love how the circularly shaped part in the middle sits on each of my eyes.  The fastening mechanism manages to be relatively secure without compromising your ability to sleep on it (a very difficulty balance!).  I tend to pull it off at some point during my sleep, but it doesnt fall off on its own.  I should note that I am a heavy sleeper -- the fastening mechanism might not work as well for someone who is restless.I deducted one star because I HATE the color pink and would have preferred the option of other colors."
'4'.'0',"Great comfort, blocks light perfectly",Great product but a little overpriced. I use it every day now and even for daytime naps when I have to make up sleep from all night emergency work sessions when I'm on call.It's not as heavy as I expected but that is solved with the design It has for the wrap-around.What I love is HOW it is weighted.  You can use it easily slewing one your back OR in your side
'4'.'0',It does a good job at sealing out the light. First it feels fine but after a few minutes it's a little heavy (and uncomfortable) on my eyes. I think a little less stuffing this would be perfect.  I like how it doesn't have to go around my head and it just kind of drapes over your eyes.,"Add me to the of happy sleepers whod given up on sleep masks until finding the nodpod. Its comfortable and comfortING. I love the weight on my face, and the ""pods"" on the side dont prevent sleeping on my side. My only minor complaint is that the fastening process-pulling one end through a buttonhole on the other end--doesnt always ensure a secure fit through the night. Not enough of an issue to worry about and Id buy another in a heartbeat. Im looking forward to using it on my next long flight."
'4'.'0',"Im addicted to this product. It is my first sleep mask and I am so pleased with how easy it is to maneuver throughout the night.  I purchased it because I struggled to remain asleep when my husband got off work late at night and this has help tremendously. Also, my 5 yo tried it, loves it, and it puts him to sleep within minutes. My only complaint is that some of the stitching came undone within the first week.",Comfortable and stays in place
'4'.'0',"I ordered this because I thought it would help with migraines.  I usually use a weighted pillow or the warmth and weight of my husbands palm.  I used it the last few nights even though I didnt have a migraine.  It is a light weight band.  It stays securely around my head.  I bought the black one which also gives me a blackout effect.  That is an added bonus, because my bedroom gets a lot of sunlight.",The item is fantastic! The only issue I have (hence the 4 ...
'4'.'0',"The item is fantastic!  The only issue I have (hence the 4 stars) is that it needs something to hold it tightly about my head.  The ability to loop it through the back is ingenious, but it fails to stabilize the hold.  Perhaps if a little Velcro could catch the remainder of what comes through the hole would help...?  I dont sew, so I have to knot the thing the keep it from sliding which it ""still"" does but not as badly.","Great, but the beads fell out!"
'4'.'0',"I loved this for a few months but eventually the beads fell out and I was unable to use it anymore. Would recommend more durable stitching to keep it all together, but was a good weight and texture for sleeping otherwise!",I love this weighted eye mask.  My one complaint is that my eyes can't breathe and when I wake up they are dried out.  But it so comfortable and helps me sleep better the minor is worth it.  Mine stays on all night.  My husband's falls off in the middle of the night.  He loves his also.  We keep them in the freezer for a nice cool eye pack falling asleep.  Helps with my headaches.
'4'.'0',Disappointed as beads falling out,"I really like the Nod Pod but have had an issue with the beads falling out!  One day I woke up to find beads all over bed.  One of the pockets had come undone. I picked up the beads and sewed the pocket back together.  Lately, I find a few beads at a time in the bed.  No visible openings in pod but, somehow, they are getting out.  For that price, I expected better quality!"

'4'.'0',"Hey! So I never leave reviews but I had to leave one for this product.Maybe you are a weirdo like me, but I consistently need some sort of weight on my forehead to sleep, and I often cannot sleep with lights in the room. For awhile, this was my forearm laid over my forehead, which made my arm fall asleep and didnt work all that well. But then I found this little nodpod! I have a lot to say so ill put it into pros and cons.Pros:",Detailed review of who this works for
'4'.'0',"I am a terrible sleeper, everything wakes me multiple times a night",The weight feels good and there are two sides with different textures which is nice. But it doesn't really help with sleeping. Three people in my house agree. Feels good but doesn't put you to sleep. Good for just relaxation.
'4'.'0',I love everything about this product I just wish it was a tiny bit heavier as it is replacing a heavy feather pillow that I had on my head or face before that . This is definitely an upgrade and I have gotten used to it I recommend get a bright color as I keep losing the black one,90% amazing for a night worker
'4'.'0',"I work nights, so Ive been trying different masks to block out the sun and this is the best one so far. The only issue I have is that it doesnt actually help with headaches... when I use it with a headache it feels too heavy on my eyes.","Works great, but could be better"
'4'.'0',For the price I was a little disappointed that it arrived smelling like someone's greasy hair and there were white hairs on it (my hair ain't white lol). I'm assuming it was used and returned. It really wasn't worth going through the return process for me?? so I just threw it in the washer and it came out perfectly fine! It does stay in place IF you are a still sleeper and the weight is perfect. They could definitely improve it with velcro or some sort of button to keep it in place. I had a migraine yesterday and the pressure helped a lot so I decided to write a review and say it is definitely worth the buy despite its few downsides.,Great for the dark but not great in bright light
'4'.'0',"This works so much better than I anticipated! I thought it would annoy me and flop around everywhere but I like this design so much more than my old elastic one. My one complaint is that it's not great in bright rooms. It completely blocks out your surroundings, but direct light can still go through the oat","Buy your partner one, too."
'4'.'0',"I love my Nodpod. I'm obsessed with it and cannot sleep without it. I'm a side sleeper and sleep with the pods on my eyes and one ear, which blocks out all light and muffles sounds. My husband likes to borrow it when he takes naps, which triggers me because I'm so weirdly attached to it. I finally ordered him one at 2am when he stole it from me, claiming a headache. The bead pressure does help with that.I didn't give it 5 stars because the velvet side is scratchy on my eyelids, and I never use it. The fabric is very durable, but I'd prefer if it were a little softer. I wish the 'cool?? side was made of slippery fabric, like a nice stretchy satin.",I really like this sleep mask! I used to have to sleep with my arm or a pillow over my eyes but this completely solves that issue. There's a small slit in one side so you can try to wrap it around your head but it doesn't lay greatly but can still be tight enough to block out daylight. Worth the buy in my opinion
'4'.'0',"I have only used this two nights so far, but Id say theres nothing magic about it. Its ok, but I dont know that it helps me sleep more deeply. I got it because my eyelids wont stay shut during the night (even with regular sleep masks) and are severely dry. It does seem to help them stay shut a little more than usual, but Im a side sleeper so it would probably work even better on a back sleeper. Its definitely not too heavy or too light, and it doesnt make me hot.","Wonderful, but for how long?"
'4'.'0',"This is helping me relax before sleep and throughout the day, and I love it. My only concern is that the beads are made from polyethylene, which I'm having trouble finding information about in terms of whether or not it's 100% safe. I tend to wake up a few hours into the night feeling very hot until I take the mask off, but that could be due to using a fleece fabric in the height of summer. In any case, I'm pretty sure this mask isn't biodegradable, which I only realized after opening the package, so I'm docking one star on account of that regret. Otherwise it's a wonderful product.",Great but can't be washed
'4'.'0',Love it. Only problem is you can't wash it in the washing machine.,I work night shift so needed a mask to help sleep better during the day. The two different sides are very nice for when it's winter versus the summer months. I do think the pressure on my eyes helps me fall asleep faster. However if you are a person who moves a lot in your sleep then be prepared for it to fall off your face every once in a while.
'4'.'0',Beneficial for shift workers,I occasionally work night shifts and have trouble sleeping during the day. This definitely helps me fall asleep quicker but Im not completely convinced that it helps me stay asleep as much.
'4'.'0',"This eye pillow is different from others I have had in that it has four ""pillows"" that fit comfortably over my eyes when sleeping on my side or my back. I would prefer more weight but have not been able to find that anywhere.",Nice but EXTREMELY overpriced
'4'.'0',"I like this, it could be a bit bigger and heavier but the design is nice. It seems crazy expensive for a small amount of fabric some poly pellets.",Good for mild head and eye pain
'4'.'0',"Got this for my boyfriend who gets migraines and has trouble sleeping. He likes the pressure and that he can lay on his side and its still comfortable. He has to tie it around his head to stay on, but its not tight light a typical sleep mask elastic.When my eyes were sore, I put it in the freezer for maybe 5minutes and wore it over my eyes. It  doesnt freeze but it got cold enough to provide some pain relief.It doesnt get rid of your migraine by any means but it does ease the pain long enough for you to fall asleep. Better than a wet towel that drips and gets warm too quickly. Better than an eye mask that has no pressure.Bonus, comes in a cute tube. Not a generic box. ?'?","This definitely helps me sleep faster but as a side sleeper, it falls off my face. I've tried to tie it in the back and that helps, but I always wake up with it off of my face. I like the weight on my eyes and love the dual side action it offers ' nice to have a cooling feel some nights and warmer on other nights. Overall I like it :)"
'3'.'0',"I see the vision behind this product, but it honestly didnt do any magical things for my sleep. It just doesnt live up to the hype for me, personally.I move and roll around too much in my sleep for it to stay in one place, despite trying to use the small hole in the back. It also doesnt have enough weight for me; the pressure is too gentle to give my eyes the relaxing feeling that a weighted blanket does for my body.I will say, its very soft and comfy. If youre not a schmoover in your sleep, it will probably work much better for you than it did for me. I dont think its a bad product ' just a bad fit for my sleep habits.",White color lets in a lot of light
'3'.'0',"I have one in green.  Love so much.  Have given a NodPod as a gift to five people, including a white one.  I recently lost my green so ordered white.  I am disappointed it doesnt block the light nearly as well as green or dark grey (my sons).",Unfortunately not what I was hoping for
'3'.'0',"??I've been searching for a quality eye mask that doesn't block my eyelids from opening, doesn't have buckles or clasps and has a therapeutic effect without slipping down/off my head before morning.Unfortunately the method of pulling the one end of the eye mask through the hole of the other end is not enough for securement. I'm having trouble finding masks that I don't wake up with the falling off, so maybe it's the size of my head being too small, but I feel Velcro, a button or something is needed.In terms of the weight, feel, material, those are all great.",Super soft however not great for side sleepers
'3'.'0',I really wanted it to work for me as it did for others but I am a side sleeper and I toss and turn a lot. If I am on my side with this on then some of it rests on my ear and I can hear the little grains inside moving so its quite loud. I have the same problem if I am moving from side to side.,"This is a lovely sleep mask, super soft, gorgeous color and obviously a well made product, BUT its WAY to light. When they say ""gentle pressure"" they mean barely any at all. Im sending it back. Id rather drape a hand towel across my face for essentially the same pressure, and save $34."
'3'.'0',Design Flaw,"I own several nodpods ' basically, one for each bed in my home and one for the sofa. To be clear, I generally like them. And I find them to be great for mid-day naps when I typically sleep on my back. They're soft and cool when first put on and the weight is just right for me. However, they heat up pretty fast (because of body heat), which can at times be less than comfortable. They also don't really fasten, so if you're not a back sleeper or you move too much during your sleep they will slide off. I'm only giving the product 3 stars because, despite my appreciation for the nodpod for napping purposes, the design is basically lacking. The slot that's supposed to allow you to pull the other end through (in an effort to fasten the eye mask) is WAY TOO SMALL/SHORT thereby rendering it useless. If they would've made the slot twice as long/wide I think it would've worked out but for some strange reason it's only about as wide as the diameter of a nickel. Given that the material used to make the nodpod is so plush, it's a struggle to pull it through a slot that's so small, and you're not going to get very far. So the mask will slide off if you move during sleep, and if you're a side or stomach sleeper, this eye mask will prove useless by the time sunrise rolls around. The design flaw can easily be fixed (just widen the slot for Pete's sake) but seeing as how they've gotten this far without doing so, I wouldn't be surprised if the manufacturer doesn't address the issue."
'3'.'0',"Nice design, faulty construction","I like the NodPod and have used it each night since receiving it on February 17. However, the stitching has come loose between two of the pods. This results in the contents shifting between the area of two pods??it is like having 2 normal pods and one really long one where the contents is distributed unevenly. Super annoying when you shift positions to sleep at night. The return window closed March 21 and I noticed the defect today, March 27. :("
'3'.'0',Not the same as previous purchase,"Update- after a few washes it is a bit softer but still not quite the same.I had one of these I bought at least two years ago, that I loved! I lost it while traveling and the replacement one I purchased does not feel like the same fabric. There is not a cool side, although each side has a different fabric both sides feel warm and the 'cool?? side makes me itch. My previous one on a cool night felt a little chilly at times and I would turn it to the warm side. After trying for a few nights with this itchy, warm eye mask I'm giving up and returning it."
'3'.'0',"Useful, but maybe not the best for side sleepers","I have trouble with my silk sleep masks falling off, so I thought Id try this. Its great while Im sleeping on my back. Its comfortable, and the bit of added weight is relaxing. But I felt like I had to keep waking up to adjust it every time I switched sides. Fastening it around your head wont work for side sleepers because its too thick. I ended up using it on top of my silk sleep mask. It holds it in place and for some reason doesnt move around as much when I switch sides."
'3'.'0',"Not heavy; however, nice and long","Product is long and good for Turing or moving as you fall asleep. It however is not weighted which is what is nice about eye pillows, the weight helps smooth and relax this part of the face. It is not scented which is fine but could be a nice addition. I like that it does not have to be strapped to my head"
'3'.'0',I really wanted to like this! Unfortunately I toss and turn too much for it to stay on. I was constantly adjusting it and taking it off in frustration.  I even used the cool side and it was still too warm for me. The concept is great and I can definitely see it being more helpful for less rowdy sleepers than me.,Overpriced for what you get
'3'.'0',I was expecting this to be nicer quality considering how expensive it is. I'm disappointed. It's no different than any other 'weighted?? sleep mask. I'd say save your money and get one of the less expensive ones. They're nicer. I can't get over how cheaply made this thing is and I paid $34 for it. I feel like a chump.,I use it on my forehead & not my eyes
'3'.'0',I use this on my forehead when I have a headache. I dont like the lumpiness on my eyes & it falls off too easily. Ill stick to my eye mask & buy something flat & heavy next time for my forehead.,It says gentle pressure but I still think its a bit too heavy for my eyes.
'3'.'0',"It doesn't stay put and keep my eyes covered, even when I use the loop to tuck in on end. I went back to my regular sleep mask.",Color and size a bit off.. but good product.
'3'.'0',Nice product. Its a tad smaller then I expected it to be... but buyer beware on the color Sedona. I expected this to be a tan/orange hue.  But it really looks more like a pink to me... in case your gifting this to a male. Its definitely reading more of a pink hue then tan or orange.,Sleep Guru Here -- Not sure how i feel about this one. dont use but sometimes find it a q for sleep
'3'.'0',Sleep Guru Here,"I wish this had slightly more weight to it. As a frequent migraine sufferer, a bit more pressure would be better"
'2'.'0',Not real excited with this. Its very light,This product does keep the light out and is soft  but the little 'bean bags?? go all the way around to the side of my head causing me to lay in a lump. I tried to ignore it but it caused my neck to lift up off my pillow making my neck hurt. Will not use again.
'2'.'0',Almost no weight to it. If you are actually looking for weighted.,The problem with this is that it's extremely light weight. I was expecting more weight since it's supposed to be weighted. It just feels like a black out mask. It's soft but just not weighted to really help. It feels like you just have a light blanket over your eyes.
'2'.'0',Broken seams so beads have shifted,Super comfortable but I guess not very well made and cheaply sewn together. The center seams have already busted after minimal use and the beads now shift creating uneven weight on either side.Super comfortable but for the price it should not already be falling apart.
'2'.'0',I feel like this should be heavier. Sent it back,It's a great idea and it's soft but it's not heavy enough for me. I'm returning.
'2'.'0',The Mask Doesnt Stay In Place,"This mask is very comfortable, the material is soft and the weight feels good, the problem is that the mask moves around. The manufacturer needs to modify the hole and strap insert method. I am returning it after a long night of attempts to keep the maks on."
'2'.'0',The concept is great,Great idea but poor design
'2'.'0',I love the idea of tightening this around my head for headaches.  I did not like the pressure the 'pod?? put on my eyes.  This was just not comfortable for me.,"I bought this for my wife, it works great but only lasted  2months. She used it every night and it helped her sleep. But after the 2 months the seams separated and the beads fell out. Bummer."
'2'.'0',Terrible quality for the price.,For a sleep mask to be so much more expensive then others you would expect better quality. The item after 1 wash on delicate already has seems coming loose and microbeads falling out. The item is soft and comfortable but just not worth the cost compared to other sleep masks.
'2'.'0',I ordered this after I left my beloved Manta sleep mask in a hotel while traveling. I just am disappointed all around. I wanted to love it,"Product not worth the expensive price. Unnecessary Expensive packaging! fabric way too hot, even on what's supposed to be the cool side! I actually sweat around my eyes & you don't sleep when you sweat! It did block light. Should have returned, would not recommend. Needs some redesigning with changing to a cooler fabric & I thought it to be too bulky too much fabric, too heavy & less fancy packaging to lower the price!"
'2'.'0',"The old Nodpod was heavier, fabric was softer & nicer and it was well made. The one I just ordered feels light, cheap and flimsy and MORE expensive! Very disappointing!!!","I must be a more restless or sensitive sleeper than over 150 others who reviewed and loved this product.  I bought it mainly to block out light when I was sleeping. It was uncomfortable no matter how I positioned myself or the Nodpod.Draped across my eyes 'either on my side or back'it would slip off.Tucked under my head when I lay on my side or stomach'lumpy and uncomfortable. With one tab slid through the other in any position'also uncomfortable.Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it was if no use to me whatsoever.If anyone has any tips, please let me know."
'2'.'0',I dont think its really for aide sleepers,I toss and turn alot at night. And honestly there are two main weighted parts for the eyes which are amazing. But the ones on the side push on your temple.
'2'.'0',Issue that isnt brought up,"I loved this eye mask, have used it for over a year... but what Ive noticed is that my eyelashes have started growing in unnatural directions and are in complete disarray. The pressure from this mask most definitely had some influence on this situation Im in. I wonder if Im alone in this. I will not be using it anymore... its time to give my eyelashes a dang break."
'2'.'0',The mask does not stay fitted to your face and slips off easily. If your a side sleeper don't buy these.,heavier than expected
'2'.'0',"I knew the mask was weighted, but was surprised by how much. I expected it to be fitting to my face, but not squishing my eyeballs weight, and maybe this was my mistake. The mask itself though is not wide enough. It covers you eyes, but needs more width to keep out light",Beanie baby that covers your eyes
'2'.'0',No way to keep closed,Why in the world would they not have some Velcro or SOMEthing to keep it closed'  Id return this but I dont see any alternative.  I like the weight and the comfort but for this price '  Ridiculous
'2'.'0',doesnt work as described,"The weight, and the cool and warm sides were perfect. However, it would not stay on my head. Threading one end through the slit is a poor design...nothing secures the hold"
'2'.'0',The weight is tiny beads that have no structured positioning which make is annoying to use.,"This is so uncomfortable its almost useless.  I would have returned it, but I waited too long after a vacation to do so."
'2'.'0',I've purchased better,Very heavy / light is not completely trapped
'2'.'0',Over priced for the quality,I've considered buying one of these for several years but the price always stopped me. Recently my boyfriend randomly decided to buy it for me.As soon as I took it out of the packaging I was convinced I had received a counterfeit. The texture was sort of rough and not velvety and the weight seemed insubstantial. I even went online and looked at pictures of other ones because I was sure this could not be an item that was priced at 40$This is a weird comparison but it's extremely accurate: remember how the real beanie babies were super soft and velvety and had weight to them? (That's sort of what I imagine the nodpod would feel like) Then McDonald's came out with happy meal beanie babies and they were made of scratchy material and didn't have that heft to them. The nod pod is like the same texture as the McDonald's beanie babies and feels like it's filled with styrofoam beads.
'2'.'0',Not what I was expecting,The product should have been more weighted and doesn't stay on.
'2'.'0',Move in your sleep? Not for you.,"I'm an active sleeper often moving around and flopping from side to side. As you can imagine, this design doesn't cater well to the activity and usually ends up around my neck in the morning. It's soft and a great weight but this doesn't stay put unless you do."
'3'.'0',How are you supposed to keep this on? Only good if you are on your back.,"I'm not using it anymore, back to using a long black slip."
'3'.'0',blocks light but would have liked a little more weight.  Hard to  insert into slit provided to wrap around head.,Doesn't stay on if you move a lot
'3'.'0',Like the product but it's a little heavy on the eyes.,blocks light but would have liked a little more weight
'3'.'0',Let's first acknowledge how amazing the weighted mask feels just laying in bed and relaxing. It's like an off switch for my brain if I want 10 minutes of peace. I love the slight pressure on my eyes when it lays just right.But that's the problem. It's damn near impossible to get it to lay just right. To get the beads inside to equally distribute so that each side is sitting evenly and the pressure is consistent. If you're the type of person that has anxiety and hyperfocuses or fixates on small differences this mask will drive you bonkers. You'll never get the thing to center correctly or the beads to settle just right.Now say you aren't an obsessive perfectionist but just someone that varies their sleep position through the night. A tosser and turner if you will??.but not even in the restless way. In the 'I love when I roll over and find a new spot of cool sheet and pillow under me?? way. This mask has to be taken off and repositioned to accommodate each and every effing position change all. night. long.  You finally get it right while laying on your back and all you can think about is how badly you want to turn to your side??and if you need to get up to pee in the middle of the night? Oof. The dang thing is tossed on the nightstand and left as a lost cause at that point.If it had a way to secure it more firmly behind your head?? or fewer weighted pockets so no matter how you lay you didn't have to slide it left or right like the sleep version of an early 2000s song you dance to at weddings?? and perhaps if the pockets were sewn just a bit tighter to keep the beads from shifting around??This product is excellent for a very particular type of sleeper. It will not drape across your lids and magically turn you into that type of sleeper either. Are you a type A sheet surfer with obsessive tendencies? Might be better to go find a mask with a strap.,Was awesome for the first week but then melted after only a few seconds in the microwave :(
'3'.'0',"Comfy, but causes temporary vision problems",Excellent for a particular type of sleeper
'3'.'0',I have been sleeping now for five days with non,"I want to like this.  Its very soft, the weight is good, and I LOVE the back closure (velcro on my old mask was pulling at my hair).  BUT, I hate that the eye pieces arent contoured.  It sounds like some people like it, but it pushes on my eyelids and is uncomfortable.  I like the weight around the eye socket area, but prefer my actual eyes to be free to move, and not feel like the mask is smashing my eyelashes and rubbing my eye cream off."
'3'.'0',"Edit: after three months of using this Im sad to say that I do still wish this was heavier. I am still having trouble sleeping again even after using this consistently. I really hoped I had found something to help me long term but I guess the search continues. The quality is good, it just doesnt work for me.","I like the NodPod overall. The material is soft and it's actually pretty comfortable to wear. I don't find myself adjusting it like other masks I've tried, and I like that you can either wear it tied around your head or just lay it across your eyes, the latter of which is great for my yoga cool down, especially after I've had it in the freezer. It does a mostly good job of blocking light, but I have a pink one, so the lighter color tends to let a little bit of light through when the sun is out. I always wish I got a darker color so that it would block light better.But I have one major complaint. Whenever I wear the NodPod overnight, I wake up with extremely blurred vision, to the point where I can't even read my phone or the clock, and it usually takes over an hour to correct itself. I don't wear glasses or contacts, so normally my vision is fine. I know I'm not tying it too tight because it falls right off my head when I sit up. Despite the comfort, maybe the weight is just putting too much pressure on my eyes. I can't imagine that wearing this every night is good for me so I'll probably just continue using it for short periods, like if I have a headache or after yoga.So I like it, but I just can't wear it overnight."
'3'.'0',"Excellent quality, poor design",After 3 months review..
'3'.'0',Great concept.  Much better than an eye mask.  Mine had bad stitching and leaked beads.,"Highly recommend this for anyone that has trouble falling asleep like I do. The weights apply a gentle amount of pressure that keeps your eyelids closed and is very relaxing. I feel very well rested in the mornings when I use it. However, the design is poor. Its meant to be adjustable for everyone, but it is so poor that it doesnt stay on securely. If you roll around a lot it will not stay put unless you add some Velcro or something to help hold it in place. Overall, I do like it more than any other sleeping mask Ive tried. I feel its excellent quality but poor design."
'3'.'0',This sleep mask is too heavy.,"This product is okay but I cant wear it well when I sleep on my side. My head is small, and I cant make this close tight enough for me. That also means it is bumpy on the side when I try it. I need you to make one with a smaller circumference."
'3'.'0',"The material is very comfortable, soft on the skin. Unfortunately, the mask is too heavy, I woke up with marks on my face, and really hard to open my eyes after a night of sleep.","I agree with the commenters who wish there was a way to get it to secure more tightly.Until I started finding little plastic beads in my bed, I really liked the product.  I returned the one I had, but Ill probably get another.  Would have been four starts if it werent for the bad stitching.  Five stars if you could secure it more tightly."
'3'.'0',"The mask slips off and if you like sleeping on your side you can feel the filling (feels like hundreds of small balls inside) patching into your ear.. not very comfortable , it would make a much better product if it was foam inside, not plastic balls",Wish It was Made Better
'3'.'0',Having to tie this vs some form of Velcro creates a big knot behind the head which makes this near impossible to be comfortable in that regard. Weight is nice but big knot leaves this needing a better engineered way to secure it on your head.,This will hurt your ears
'3'.'0',"When pulled tight, the tension does help my migraines somewhat but too uncomfortable to wear long. Also, as stated in past reviews, it's difficult to keep it tight. I am not happy enough with it to go to the trouble of adding Velcro and buttons.",Nice but needs a better way than tying a knot.
'3'.'0',If you are a side sleeper this is not for you. Perfect for back sleepers. The Weight is perfect and does exactly what you want it to do.  But this product doesnt snap or velcro in only loops through a hole and if you are a side sleeper will fall down or up.,"Even when wearing on the 'cool?? side, it is very hot."
'3'.'0',"It's ok, I left my Barmy one at a hotel and needed a replacement. This does the job, sort of. Doesn't block out ambient room light though and doesn't stay in place like my old one. Weight is very light. Def going back for another Barmy.",Not for side or stomach sleepers
'3'.'0',Misleading photo...smaller than pictured,Overall I like this product but the pictures show a sewn hole in one of the sides so you can thread the other side into it and mine doesn't have that so I have to rely on gravity. Not sure if I'm going to return because I do like the product but for the price I'm not sure it's worth it
'3'.'0',"Product states to wash before using. After first gentle wash, one of the seams broke so the inside beads aren't broken up between 2 of the pods. This makes it more difficult and not as comfortable to use throughout the night as I would assume it'd be if all 4 pods were separated by the seam.",Kept falling off of my face even when tied in the back. Looks nice and the idea feels relaxing but it doesn't do much
'3'.'0',The weight could be better. But it does help with headaches.,"The actual product I received was MUCH smaller than the photo or video included on the listing with the pretty blond girl having a wonderful nights sleep.  Also, the ""slit"" in the back is so small that it is almost impossible to tie this at the back of the head without enlarging the slit with a pair of scissors.  Finally, it can be washed, but not put in the dryer, and it takes many days to air dry completely.  The weight that is supposed to be so relaxing on the eyes isnt really because the product isnt as big as is shown."
'3'.'0',Finally found the perfect sleep mask for my migraines,"Helps with headaches, not so much migraines."
'3'.'0',I thought I had read that the NodPod could also be warmed in the microwave in addition to cooled in the freezer. The directions mention not heating it in the microwave.I do like the comfort level and weight. I wanted the advantage of having weighted and heated sections on my temples when experiencing a migraine. But it cant happen apparently.,"It's very difficult to keep this product on my face when I am sleeping. It falls off easily, cannot be adjusted to fit a smaller face and once it falls off if you wake up it's purpose is defeated. ?'? I wish I could adjust it to fit my face as it is very soft and just the right weight!"
'3'.'0',"I've tried to like this on numerous occasions. It does block out all light which is fantastic but it puts a ton of pressure on my eyes which makes my migraine worse. And you have to make sure that they're directly lined up. But my biggest complaint is that it should have Velcro or something to keep it secure because the way it is now you have to slip this big piece through a small slit and pull it through to tighten it and it doesn't state heightened and it leaves a big bump so it's uncomfortable.  Maybe one of my friends will have more luck with that than I do. It just seems to hurt my face more than it should, but I also have a lot of health issues so that could be part of the reason why. But the back really needs to be reworked regardless....",Not for the microwave
'3'.'0',Comfortable for the most part,Not the most comfortable but it does block out light
'3'.'0',It doesn't stay on when Rossi g and turning have to constantly keep  readjusting will be returning this item,"I like the shape, design and concept of this sleep mask.  Its comfortable for the most part and the design enables you to drape it across your face comfortably whether you are sleeping on your back or side.  The only problem I have experienced is that the weight of the beads presses against my corneas so that I awaken with irritated eyes if I have been sleeping on my back.  After I drape the mask across my face I sort of squish the beads into the surrounding area of the pouches leaving the part directly over my eyes free and that does help somewhat, but the beads do seems to drift back into place while I sleep.  If I were going to design this for myself I would probably use less weight in the two center pouches."
'3'.'0',"Bought it for my mother and she didnt care for it so I tried it out.  While its soft, for me its not as effective as a simple sleep mask.  Heavy so it slips and requires adjustment during the night.  Disappointed since it was costly and highly rated.","Id wanted this since the first time I saw it, but for me, it doesnt work as wonderfully as I had hoped.  The sections were unevenly filled with beads, the ""cool"" side was a fabric that wasnt necessarily ""cool"", and importantly, the buttonhole was so small it was impossible to thread the other end thru it.  Great concept, but possibly more product control is needed."
'3'.'0',All beads fell out when cleaning this,Wish I liked this soft sleep aid
'3'.'0',I'm so disappointed with this. It's itchy on my eyes so I can't sleep with it. Also not as heavy or large as I hoped. So expensive and really not worth it,Fell apart when washing
'3'.'0',"Positives: keeps out the light; added benefit of covering ears once done up which keeps out the noise too. Helps to reduce puffy eyes in the morningNegatives: does not stay tied up; moves around during the night; because of constant retightening during the night, thread has torn and beads are falling out. I've only used about 5 times since January given I couldn't figure out how to keep it on so I didn't get good use out of it for $40If they just figured out a way to properly secure it, it would be ALMOST worth it",Itchy and not very weighted
'3'.'0',"Another one of those this will help you sleep scams.  Again, I read a review that swore this weighted mask is the best thing since sleeping pills.  My version of the review.I have gone to sleep wearing this, usually with the help of a sleeping pill.  I used it for several weeks. I tended to pull it off in the night.  Havent used it in weeks.

'3'.'0',Not great for side sleeper. The beads are located almost all around so sleeping on your side isnt comfortable. Doesnt stay in place. Had high hopes for this and stopped using it,"For me at least, the knot you have to tie in back comes loose and also creates a lump your head lays on. I don't use it."
'3'.'0',Not worth the price. Not as weighted as described.,Not for side sleepers
'2'.'0',Much smaller than pictured.,I would love to give these a 5 star but they just don't stay cold that long.
'2'.'0',"It is comfortable, but the stitching came apart in two places (in less than a month) so now the beads from two of the pockets travel through them all the way to one of the corners. For the price, I would hope for stronger or better quality stitching.","It's ok, took forever to arrive and is about half the size that's pictured on the model.  Just big enough to cover eyes, very lightly weighted. Not really what I expected based on photos/other reviews."
'2'.'0',"While it looks like the mask is very comfortable and will get the job done, sadly the one that was shipped to me doesnt have the slit that it should have, so theres no way to secure it. So be warned that you may have to return it to get a non defective one.","I have been eyeing this product for months and finally took the plunge - everything about it seemed like it would help me fall asleep. It is soft, pretty and well made, though I expected it to be a bit bigger all around. My problem is that I sleep with my head slightly elevated and no matter what I tried (and I wanted to love this thing) the Nodpod slipped down my face within seconds. Additionally, I am particularly sensitive to light. I ordered the coral colored one and could see faint brightness, even with my eyes closed, so if you are considering this item and have light sensitivities, you may want to consider a darker color."
'2'.'0',this isn't that great and i was so excited to get it because i love using a sleep mask and i get awful headaches. it's almost impossible to keep on for an extended period of time so you can't really wear to sleep in. it could be a lot heavier too. the cold is nice and i keep it in a plastic bag in my freezer so it doesn't collect smells from the freezer as i hate smells especially when i get a headache. it's just alright. i would return it if i hadn't used it already. save ur money and buy a cheaper sleep mask or ice pack,Defective - came without slit
'2'.'0',"I had high hopes for this, but didn't feel that my sleep quality had changed because of it. I like that it has a cotton side (I can't stand the feel of the polyester","I was really excited about this product but it's not really what I thought it would be like.1) there's a tiny hole you have to pull the other strap in. I tried that last night and it never stayed. I then tried to tied it and woke up later and that also didn't stay. I'm probably going to have to buy some Velcro and sew it on to make it work.2) Those microbeads move around and depending on how you lay, they shift. Sometimes they shift to under your eye or to the side and it doesn't feel right. The only way you have an even amount of pressure is if you lay straight on your back. So if you're a side sleeper like me, it won't feel as comfortable or right."
'2'.'0',"It's packaged cute but doesn't work. I wanted it to work so bad. It's not weighted like you would think. It slides around, the hook thing is a joke. If you put it in the freezer, it stays cold/cool for about 10 minutes. You can't microwave it. Oh well","Overpriced, didn't work for me"
'2'.'0',Very soft but I had trouble keeping the on,I wanted it to work so bad
'2'.'0',,My expectations were not met for the price. It is just a soft long length of fabric with pocket of beans in it. Had I been aware I would not have purchased it at the price I paid 2 months ago. The  product and materials used do not match the price for the description the product provides
'2'.'0',"These come in a really cute package. Af first, I loved every about these. However, after  a month of wearing this every night the beads have moved to one side and I am unable to get them back in the right spot.","I can't sleep without a mask on.  The problem with these is you're supposed to lay on your side and they stay in place. However, it did not work like that for me. I found myself throughout the night searching for the mask and trying to stabilize????. I would not recommend them if you move a lot during your sleep."
'2'.'0',"This product cause a reaction on my face. Small red bumps where the fabric came in contact. Full transparency, I did not wash it before using it the first time. After the reaction, I washed it on the gentle cycle and waited a few days before trying it again.And it happened again.I'm disappointed because I liked the product itself. But I won't use it at the expense of my skin.",Pink color doesn't block out TV light.
'2'.'0',"This was barely heavier than my normal sleep mask. I also rotate between back and side sleeping, and there's no way to fasten it so you can do both",Caused a skin reaction
'2'.'0',Does not stay on the face.,"Too light, didn't stay in place"
'2'.'0',"Nice, but does not stay on and was originally sent a used one","So much is going well with this product, it's sad to have to give it a bad review but it lets in a ton of light ' the fabric isn't thick enough and is also the wrong color to do it's job effectively: block light for a deeper more restful sleep. Fail."
'2'.'0',"Loved it, but already faulty :(","I feel like this product was a great idea, but whoever created it needs to make some adjustments with how well it stays on. This is not stay on well at all. It always falls off no matter how tight you adjust it and it is not good for traveling either. It is way too heavy and falls off your eyes. If you use it laying down and you turn to adjust yourself, it falls off, and you have to readjust it."
'2'.'0',"Meh, pass. Good idea though","I like this, it is wonderful if I have a migraine , but it is impossible to use at night. Even after tightening it, it falls off. They market it for side sleepers, but the only way this would work is if you slept on your back and didnt move at all.I also had to return and reorder as they originally sent me a used one that had animal fur on it."
'2'.'0',This did nothing for my issues.  Might work for someone else.,"Really loved my mask, but after less than a month of use the sewing has let go, and now one bubble is flat...pretty much cant use it"
'2'.'0',,"Not that heavy, the divinding seem broke almost immediately making it lopsided. Over priced for the product."
'2'.'0',I bought 2 of these mask from Amazon. One pink one black. Then I found a gray one at Marshall's. I've been using all 3 for months now. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1. It's weighted,"This did absolutely nothing to help improve my sleep.  Its personal, so maybe it might work for someone else."
'2'.'0',Pros,"Ehh, not as great as I'd hoped :/"
'2'.'0',"I bought one of these a year ago, lost mine and just repurchased. I knew right away they had changed the design. The product is now significantly lighter than my last nodpod, you can barely feel any weight on your face. It slides around and falls off because it is so light now, my other one stayed on all night. Not sure if this is a cost saving thing or what, but I am so bummed. I also got the wisteria color and it hardly blocks out any light. It's ok at night but in the morning it becomes a problem. Do NOT get anything other than the black color if you want to block light. I will use this but I am definitely not happy and wish I had my old one back :(",Feels great to use but doesnt do its job
'2'.'0',"Unfortunately was really disappointed in this sleeping mask. It doesnt stay on even when positioning it behind the head. I sleep on my side which this advertised the mask was good for, but in order to have it on while on your side some of the weighted part of the mask covers your ear and is really uncomfortable. The positive was it was soft and can stay cool but just didnt work for me.","I had SUCH high hopes for this product; I love draping part of my weighted blanket over my head/eyes at night because it helps me relax, so I've been looking for a mask alternative that's a little bit easier to move around. For the life of me, I cannot understand why this has such a good reviews ' it literally has the weight of a Beanie Baby plushie. It's just a beanbag. And not a particularly heavy one, at that. Even if you liked it, it is in NO WAY worth $37. Maybe 15 bucks at best. Had to return on principle for that reason"
'2'.'0',I love it and love the feel of the mask?? however only after using it 2 nights I see the stitches have came apart in 2 sections and the beads are bunching up in other pods. I can't imagine how bad it will be after a month. I really wanted to love this!!! But for spending this kind of money I need a better quality product. :(,"If this was cheaper, it would be a decent sleep mask.  Given the price, its not worth it.Pros: Super soft, design and premise is great, small balls for filling makes it flexible enough to truly conform to your eyesCons: not weighted (very light filling), the hole to loop the end through is barely big enough to fit my finger let alone a chunk of fabricHad it lived up to its advertised weighted feel it might be great.  But to pay this much for just another soft mask its worth it."
'2'.'0',Nice product,Stitching coming loose in 2 nights
'2'.'0',"These are great for migrains, but not for sleep.Despite the design, part of your brain is always waiting for these to fall off. If you strap them down, nothing is flat behind your head, so its a little uncomfortable.Forget side sleeping, just doesnt work for me...","Nice product, not for me"
'5'.'0',"I was contemplating putting black on film on all 5 of my bedroom windows. I have sleep issues and thought darkness would help. Read reviews on this mask, ordered it: I LOVE IT. I have slept so soundly. I don't toss and turn anymore. But if I roll over, it's very easy to adjust this.Recommend to anyone wanting a better night sleep.","Its soft, but thats about it"
'5'.'0',"For years Ive had light insensitivity... See the morning light and oh boy Im awake and never going back to sleep. So I tried mask after mask after mask. My grandma puts a heavy washcloth over her eyes then seals it with a mask, which I started to do but then I have lines all over my face when I wake up.Then I discovered this Nod Pod, after searching for",DEEPEST SLEEP OF MY LIFE
'5'.'0',It's really comforting and good at blocking light. The weight is Not too heavy. I've washed it a few times and had no issues on a gentle cycle.,Just buy it. Its a game-changer.
'5'.'0',"These help so much with sleep, and travel way better than a weighted blanket. This is my fourth one that I've owned.It's cool on one side and warm on the other, feels great after being set in the freezer for a while (especially for migraine headaches), shuts out all the light, and is comfortable because it doesn't squeeze my head like the headband variety of sleep mask, nor does it pinch at the ears like the mask variety. Just lays over the eyes and stays there, even works while laying on my side. You *can* tie it around your head if you want, I just never do.They have to be washed sometimes, though. I suppose it might last longer if only washed by hand, but I use the washing machine. I put it in a protective bag, use the hand wash cycle on my washing machine, and then let it air dry. But after a handful of washes, the cool side fabric starts to really wear thin.Still worth it, though.",Comforting and light blocking
'5'.'0',"This has been a game changer for me. I change positions a lot when I sleep and this is fantastic for side, back, and stomach sleeping. It blocks light well and can adjusted for any gapping. Very comfortable weight and fabric. It usually falls off by the morning, but I prefer that bc I need the light to wake up. I like the gentle pressure on my eyes and that there isn't a strap to crease my hair",Can't sleep without one; wish they were more durable
'5'.'0',"I'm a fan of weighted blankets and normally fall asleep more quickly if i have some form of pressure. Weighted blankets can be too restricting sometimes and heavy duvet covers are too hot. This thing is so nice though! It's not too heavy either, i like that i don't have to adjust it if i roll over. Definitely using this next time i get a migraine too! The sage green is pretty :) if you have a hard time falling asleep give this a try!","Love it!  Great at keeping the bright morning light out of my eyes when Im trying to sleep late.  Cool side feels comfortable.  Havent tried the warm side yet.  Difficult to get the flap through the hole but once I did, it worked really well."
'5'.'0',,"I've used a number of sleep masks. The research is positive on sleep masks, lots of positive cognitive benefits. But THIS sleep mask is the BEST sleep mask ever. Cool on one side. Warm on the other. Washable. You can sleep on your back or your side. If you lose it in the middle of the night, you can find it in the dark no problem because it makes the slightest rustle. Other sleep masks go around the head; issues: if you move your head, doesn't fit right; messes with your hair; if it does stay on all night you wake up and it's bright outside, which is super odd. THIS ONE HAS NONE OF THESE ISSUES!!! YOU MUST TRY IT!! I bought one for several friends and family members and my husband and we all love it!"
'5'.'0',"When I first found the Nod Pod, I did t get the hype. Now I have two and I truly can't sleep without it. I love this product so so much. It truly is life changing. If you are struggle with chronic migraines or just sleep insomnia, get this. You won't regret it.",We each have one and fall asleep so quickly!
'5'.'0',I saw this product on TikTok and was totally influenced to buy it. I have no regrets! I fall asleep so quick with this thing and I absolutely love putting it in the freezer to use when I have a headache. I also like that it has a cool side and a warm side based on the fabric so I have options. My favorite thing about this mask is that it falls off in the middle of the night if you don't tie it so you don't wake up confused or uncomfortable if that makes sense! It completely blocks light unlike a lot of sleep masks which is also a plus!,Amazing product for travel!
'5'.'0',"Recently started struggling with sleep due to increased light sensitivity and sleep masks never fit over the bridge of my nose well enough to block out light. Dug out the Nodpod I got years ago as a birthday gift and fell in love. It's PERFECT. It conforms to my eyes and the shape of my nose so well, it's like a blackout curtain for my face. I love that I can move it around in the night and adjust it as needed, opposed to sleep masks which really have just one setting. I started sharing it with my husband for mornings I needed to turn on the light but didn't want to wake him up, and on a recent long haul flight (love that it loops thru itself so it can be used sitting up). He loved it as much as I did, so of course I had to buy him his own. Sharing is caring but love is buying your partner their own Nodpod!",This product was recommended by a friend too with dry eyes. This item provides a soothing sleepYou will enjoy
'5'.'0',"This product should be at the top of your list if you are looking for a sleep mask. It is comfortable but also helps with mild migraines and sinus issues when I need to nap during the day. The light blocking was the main reason I got this, but the added benefits and deeper sleep I get make this a top product.",I fall asleep much faster than I used to. I love the fact that I can put it in the freezer. The weight is perfect for me and it blackens out all of the light.
'5'.'0',"Love love love this lil thing! The packaging is super cheeky, and the product itself does exactly what I want! It has the perfect weight and helps me fall asleep fast! I love that I can wear it loose (fall off while I'm snoozing) or tighten it to stay on all night! And the cold side really does feel chilled (fav side)! Only negative, isn't really a big deal but some stitching between 'pods?? (?) came lose and beads will go back and forth between the two, some times leaving one pod full and the other completely empty. Normally I just redistribute them before I fall asleep. Nothing an extra stitch won't fix. 10/10 will DEFINITELY buy again. Also PERFECT for travel! (I've had it 6mths, won't ever survive without it now)",This is everything I wanted!
'5'.'0',So comfortable and useful!,"Not only is my room pitch black, but I'm liking the heavy feel of this product .. think weighted blanket helping some people sleep."
'5'.'0',"Love it, not too heavy but just enough gentle pressure to help me fall asleep. I love using this with my weighted blanket. Only downside is it not always reliable for when sitting upright like if you were on a road trip but the little slit allow you to kinda tie it in place to help it stay up.",Way better than a normal sleep mask. I love that it is a little bit weighted.
'5'.'0',"Very confortable, I can sleep better after getting this, I love it.",I have had sleep/eye masks in the past and this take it to a whole new level. The light 'pressure?? from the weighted mask puts me right to sleep. Stays on my face all night!
'5'.'0',"If you like weighted blankets, you'll love this! If you don't sleep with a weighted blanket you'll still love this!Light (of any sort) at night can disrupt your sleep, so I bought this to help with that. The fabric is soft on both sides and doesn't bother my sensitive skin at all. The 'pods' for each eye socket area fit perfectly, and you can adjust them based on your sleeping position; there are like 6 pods I think, plus extra flat fabric at each end. When I roll over I just grab an end, and adjust the pods as I want, and then fall right back to sleep. This is a very soothing product, and will help you to relax. I have tried about 5 different eye masks, and this is above and beyond anything else I've tried.If you have difficulty falling asleep (not related to sleep apnea) this will definitely help you. I would also recommend it as a relaxation tool. It's my favorite purchase from Amazon for ages!! Give it a try",This is a wonderful and comfortable type of a sleep mask! The best I've ever tried in the past.
'5'.'0',Was Skeptical but Surprised How Well it Works,Soft and just the right amount of pressure
'5'.'0',Great for stomach sleepers.,Bought this for my dog. He loves it!
'5'.'0',,"I was somewhat skeptical of this.  I was looking for a sleep mask to block the light when I came upon this. I ended up ordering an inexpensive light blocking mask, but I kept coming back to look at this for a few weeks and finally ordered it about nine months ago.I questioned whether it would work at all, and especially for a side sleeper like me.I know it sounds exaggerated, but I now almost always wake up in the position I fell asleep in. I'm not nearly as restless nor move as much in the night. I never had issues with insomnia, so it's not like it's been a miracle. But I really do get better sleep.As a side sleeper I just drape it across the side of my head and bend it to cover my eyes. I don't wrap it all the way around. I'm not exaggerating when I say I wake up with it in the same position after six or seven hours every night.I would say it's definitely worth a try if you're curious.I'm so glad I did.I've purchased another one."
'5'.'0',"I was looking for a new one because my silk eye mask was just getting way too hot on my eyes. A bit skeptical at first, I discovered that this mask works well and doesn't get hot when using the cooling side.","I was nervous buying this at first but I'm so glad I did! I tend to toss and turn some, but for the most part it stays in place! I have a street light outside my window and I don't have blinds, so I get a lot of light all hours of the day and night. The mask does a good job of blocking out light. I also have really curly hair and I didn't want a mask with a strap, so this is perfect and has been great with the hair. The only thing is that at first, I woke up with headaches, I'm assuming because of the weighted aspect, but I'm fairly used to it now. I think it was more so that I needed to adjust. So fair warning if anyone is sensitive!Now all I need to do is figure out how to quickly adjust to going from massive darkness to very bright mornings when I wake up and take my mask off lol"
'5'.'0',Just what I was looking for. Not to heavy and long enough to sleep on side.,Soothing and blocks out stimulus
'5'.'0',I love my NodPod! (S),"Product is good quality. I use this to cover my eyes for sleeping with hopes that it will help my dry eye. Color was true to picture.  The only thing I was not happy about after giving Amazon a order over the amount required, I was still charged shipping fees for this product!!!"
'5'.'0',"I love these so much, I ordered some as gifts and for travel. They are wonderful in blocking out light, stay on without any issues, and are was to clean.",I've had this for about 3 months and can't imagine sleeping without it. The most restful sleep I've gotten in years!
'5'.'0',"I was a little worried how well this eye mask would work for me given it's unconventional nature. The first night was a little tricky getting used to it, but now I sleep better than I have in a long time! The weight feels so good and comforting. The fact that it doesn't stay on if you toss around isn't a real issue because you can easily put it back on and fall right to sleep.","This is my second NodPod.  I now own two. I cant sleep without my NodPod.  I now own two because I hate to be without them. (one to wash, one to wear as it were) They have become the equivalent of a security blanket for my head. I have suffered from migraines since childhood. The search for any relief is an ongoing quest in the life of a chronic migraineur. I bought my first NodPod because I thought what could it possibly hurt to try? I am so glad I did. I am amazed that the four little weighted areas are so perfectly balanced as to give my eyes and my head the comfort I seem to need to find relief during sleep and the throes of an excruciating migraine.The NodPod is perfect for blocking out light, it moves with me, there is no constricting around my head like there is with other eye covers and it blocks out all light while giving me that perfect balanced pressure that I seek to have on my eyes and head during a migraine. It can be put in the freezer without becoming as hard as a rock, although I just choose the ""cool side"" and it is comfortable enough for me. If I want it colder: (I put it in a freezer bag to keep it from picking up the smell of the freezer) I will put it in the freezer for a couple of hours. Also: DO NOT PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE. IT WILL MELT.Other migraineurs have asked me for my opinion or recommendations for this product, so here it is. Remember, however, that every person is different and responds differently to stimuli. This may be perfect for you, or you may have to seek something that works better for you. This is just my opinion, based on my experience. From my experience, this is an excellent product, well constructed, thought out, and useful for me."
'5'.'0',,I love this mask. It's replaced all others!Pros:-comfortable-sleeping faster-cute color-softCons:-for me it has to be tied to stay on-can be tricky to put awayStill 10/10 recommend
'5'.'0',I love mine so much that I have purchased two more for friends as gifts. The Nodpod has made a huge difference in my ability to fall asleep. I have slept with it every night since I got it. Highly recommend.,I've used weighted blankets before and loved but it's too hot to use year-round. This was so comfortable and soothing. I love that you don't have a strap around your head and can adjust comfortably as you move during sleep without laying on a strap fastener which is very annoying. This and some magnesium ZzzzZ. Even if you use this for a nap or meditation practice-I recommend!
'5'.'0',"A friend of mine recommended the NodPod for better sleep. She showed me hers and I thought, 'Why would this silly thing work'? I ordered it any way??..oh my??.I have never slept so well in my life. Do set an alarm because you don't wake up for anything!",Can't sleep without it!!
'5'.'0',"I sleep so good with this weighted eye mask the best, I will never sleep without this!",This product is amazing!
'5'.'0',Best thing I've done for my sleep!,Best sleeping eye mask
'5'.'0',Better sleep than I've had in a long time!,I have a lot of trouble sleeping and this has helped immensely.
'5'.'0',Incredible sleep aid! Great for anxious sleepers,"I used to put a pillow over my head to sleep and had to wrestle with it all night long. I also had to sleep at the top of the bed so I could leverage the pillow on the headboard. It's the perfect weight and size, easy to move as I move through out the night, and super easy to take with me anywhere!"
'5'.'0',Where have you been all my life!,The pressure from this soft mask is perfect. I used to wake up 10x a night and to go back to sleep I would put a pillow over my head for pressure but would wake up with neck pain because of the awkward position the pillow put my neck in. I've only slept with this mask twice thus far. It didn't slip off or turn my hair into a birds nest.
'5'.'0',Pleasantly surprised.,"I love this product - Ill probably continue ordering these for the rest of my life if there is ever wear and tear on the one I bought!I bought this in an effort to help with anxious rumination at nighttime. I would often find myself up late, thinking about the next days problems with my eyes open! I wouldnt even realize my eyes were open since the room was dark, but it was a common occurrence. I wanted to try something to block my vision at night and randomly stumbled across this product while looking at sleep masks. The concept of a weighted mask intrigued me, so I purchased thinking I might return them but now I rarely sleep without this.Pros:- the weight in the little ""pods"" are perfect. Takes a few moments to get used to, then feels like a gentle comfortable pressure.- the texture of the fabric is different on both sides, so you can pick if you want the warmer sort of fuzzy side or the cool cotton.-You really can sleep however you want with these on - Im a side and back sleeper and I move throughout the night but this can be oriented any way that I want without issue. I usually drape it over my face and at some point in the night it does slide off but Ive fallen asleep peacefully by then!Cons:- this has a built in hole and slot system so you can sit up and wear it (for travel, I think) but this mechanism doesnt feel super secure with the weight of the pods. I havent really tested it out much but it may be a bit awkward- expensive for an eye mask, but you really get what you pay for and its well worth the money!"
'5'.'0',,I am loving this! The light weight on the eyes is very relaxing and it blocks the light better than any eye mask I've ever tried. I'm buying another one!
'5'.'0',Postpartum Insomnia Aid!,I bought it because of the positive reviews. I was afraid it would fall off my eyes but the beads help it stay in place.I'm a fan!!Edit to add now that I've had it several weeks??.this is one of my favorite things I own. Just bought a second to keep in my suitcase as I travel often.Highly recommend the Nodpod!!
'5'.'0',"I love this product. I cant go anywhere without it. I bought two to have when the other is in the wash.I did notice that the weight isnt consistent though. One weighed lighter than the other but it didnt affect how quickly I was able to fall asleep with it on.  I love that its designed so you can use it even when sleeping on your sides. Its so nice to be able to block light out completely with it on.I brought it on a trip and got stopped by TSA though. Id recommend keeping it in the tube it comes in so you can show the security guards that its an actual product. Id be devastated if they ruined it by cutting into it.The other thing I noticed since I started using it was that I started getting really bad and dark bags under my eyes. Not sure if its related but it was just something I noticed. Ive never been the type to get eye bags before so it was questionable for me. I just chalked it up to ""it could be anything"". Despite this, Im still using the mask every night. I havent found a better product that helps me fall asleep this quickly","I waited a little to give this an honest review to make sure it wasn't just a coincidence that I've been able to fall asleep faster lately. I've suffered from insomnia for most of my life so and so postpartum insomnia takes it to a new level and sleep is already hard to come by. I can't take sleep aids as they make me groggy and right now, I'm still waking with the little one numerous times a night. I've always had luck drifting off if I put a heavy pillow over my ear (I'm a side sleeper) but it also hot and makes it so hard to hear the baby because it drowns out so much sound. Not sure if it's the weight, darkness or noise cancelation that the pillow provided but it's not an option when I need to wake and tend to the baby. THIS product is lighter but still heavy enough to provide the weight, noise cancellation and darkness I need to drift off quickly and 'sleep when the baby sleeps?? but still hear the baby when needed. It's also has a surprising cooling effect. For me, it's definitely takes more than 3 the minutes to drift off as advertised, but it's better than not sleeping. I love the length of the weighted section so that I can drape over my ear for noise cancelation when on my back or side sleeping. I also love that it's not one that you have to have an elastic band around your head to secure. I'm so glad I found this and absolutely find it worth the money."
'5'.'0',Take it wherever I go...,Helps My Fall Asleep in Under Three Minutes
'5'.'0',"Comfortable, versatile","I love this mask so much, its by far the best one Ive tried. I want it pitch black when Im falling asleep and the coverage is great. The weight of it feels so cool and comfortable on the eyes and I fall asleep just like that. I like not having to wrap it around my head but I will say that I have to search my bed to find it in the morning if youre a sleeper who moves around a lot like me"
'5'.'0',Im in love with this!!!!,"Love this thing! Ive taken Nod Pod to Paris, Lisbon, Barcelona and London. Dont want to sleep without it. Zero light gets in and it feels good. I add a few drops of essential oil to it three times a week and its great. Works equally well for sleeping on your side or flat on your back. You just need to position it a  bit different for each. Use the middle two for supine and either end for side sleeping where you rap the triangle end around your head. I feel I sleep better due to it. Great purchase!"
'5'.'0',Extremely comfortable!,"This is a really great sleep mask. Not too heavy on the eyes, soft material, and no annoying elastic band around my head. And it shuts out the light. This was great for sleeping in the daytime after night shifts, and still great for sleeping at night with my day shifts."
'5'.'0',Best Ive found so far,I asked my bf for a nodpod for xmas last year - he ended up stealing it from me because its so great and I had to buy him his own.  The design is really really excellent.  The pods are like little beanbags and they settle onto your eyes so nicely and arent too heavy.  I like how they are shaped in such a way that they dont put a bunch of pressure on your nose.  It does a great job of keeping light out.  Its great for side-sleepers because you dont have to tie it - the weight of the pods keeps it in place well enough if you just lay it across your face.  If you want to tie it around your head - there is a slit on one tail that you are meant to pull the other through to sort of cinch it around your head.  Ive found that the slit is kinda small and it makes it hard to shove the other tail through BUT the tightness means it doesnt come undone.  I recommend nodpods all the time!
'5'.'0',Ive never slept so good in my life,"If you like sleeping with an eye mask these Nod Pods are hard to beat! They last forever, extremely comfortable, & don't tangle around your neck when you wake up in the morning. I throw me & my gf's in the washer with our bed sheets & good to go!"
'5'.'0',,"I previously bought one of those sleep mask with velcro that goes around your head, but it stretched out and I have a small head.  This is so much better.  I love the weight of it.  It doesnt slide off unless you toss and turn a lot.  It blocks light and has a warm and cool side. Its not itchy or annoying to me like the other types Ive tried."
'5'.'0',"I recently had a bad concussion, and all light bothered me. Even keeping my bedroom door closed and my curtains pulled tight, the light from computers, chargers, night lights, etc. still hurt. I finally got one of these after borrowing, my wifes for a few nights, and it made all of the difference. The pressure from the weight on my eyes made most of the pain go away, and they literally block every bit of light so I was able to get some good rest. I dont use it as often now, but maybe 1 or 2 nights a week I will put it on.I almost forgot, but I am a big time side sleeper, and this does not slip off if you sleep on your side. Of 8 hours of sleep, Im on my right side 6 hours and left side most of the rest, and it has not come off at all.","My fiance and I just moved into a new place, and our bedroom window unfortunately faces a streetlight. We both arent fond of curtains, and as someone who needs pitch black to sleep, I sucked it up and bought an eye mask. Ive never really been a fan of eye masks, so I did some research and this one appealed to me. And... yall. I got the best sleep of my life. It was so comfortable, especially since Im a side sleeper, and even though Im actively sick, I fell right asleep (especially when coupled with some storm sounds). Ive told all of my friends to buy it ?'?"
'5'.'0',"It's quite effective??comfy and dark??light does not sneak in??the downside is that you sleep longer, as the morning light no longer awakens you??so not so good if you need/want to get up early??",block out light when you dont have another pillow to cover your face with
'5'.'0',"I liked the material, no fragrance from the materials and the weight on my eyes. It's relaxing to use it.",You may start sleeping more??
'5'.'0',"Hands down responsible for the best sleep of my life. At this point we buy them constantly for everyone in our lives. Great design, perfect weight and so soothing. I move around a lot at night and the strap does a great job of keeping the nodpods snug and in place. Highly recommend to anyone struggling with going to sleep. Ive used different colors and they all do a great job with blocking out the light, but for complete and total darkness, get the black ones. For summer or when you have a migraine or headache, pop them in the freezer and they will work wonders.",Relaxing & comfortable
'5'.'0',I fall asleep right away and sleep like a rock.,Well thought out design. Soothing and complete blackout.
'5'.'0',"I have used many sleep masks. This is the best one ever.  Light weight, doesn't squash your eyes, washable, and helps with headaches.",The design is great! Works for side sleepers and keeps my curls from getting messed up by having to tie a strap.
'5'.'0',,"Love this thing! It helps me fall asleep right away and sleep well. My dreams are more vivid since using my nod pod. Im not sure if those are related, but its something Ive noticed."
'4'.'0',"I got this with the intention of wearing it when i get migraines, as the pressure over my eyes and forehead helps reduce the pain a lot. im so glad i got this! Its not scented which is good as scents bother me when i get migraines and it does a great job at blocking out light (both for sleep and light sensitivity with migraines) This thing is so soft and the weight is perfect on the eyelids, this will definitely be coming with me on vacations. I only took a star away because i assumed this could be microwavable (if they do make a microwave safe one i WILL be buying!) otherwise it can be put in the freezer to keep extra cool. I did notice that it doesnt get hot/too warm when you wear it, the fabric keeps it cool as you wear it. If you're thinking about getting this for yourself, or as a gift, its very worth it!! Highly recommend this. Also i love all the color variations, i have the color Wisteria","I got one for me and my boyfriend was always using it, so I got one for him too. Perfect fabric choices and weight. I like the fact you can use it without having the lock around your head."
'4'.'0',Best Sleep Ive Had in a Long While,I suffer from bouts of insomnia as well as migraine attacks. I've been using this product for months now and I fall asleep so much faster because of it. I'm a side sleeper and definitely can attest to this being the comfiest sleep mask I've tried. The beads haven't stayed evenly dispersed though - I can work around it but I think the stitching quality needs to be looked into. Overall a great product and I'm happy to have found it!
'4'.'0',To start off Im a side sleeper. For years Ive been using an old T,"I was looking for a weighted mask that would block out the ambient light and that I could comfortably wear along with my CPAP mask.  This Nodpod sleep mask meets my needs.  I really like it!!  It is soft and comfortable.  I wear it across my eyes without closing the back, and it stays on.  Personal tweaks I would made are adding a little more weight, and making it a little more narrow.  I highly recommend this."
'4'.'0',Birthday gift from lifelong dear friend.,"I saw this product on Good Morning America and immediately ordered it. Ive always insomnia no matter if I worked days or night. Im currently working night shift, and only manage to sleep a few hours at a time. I tried the NodPod the day it arrived - I managed to sleep soundly for nearly 7 hours and felt completely rested for the time in a long while. The product stayed in place-as I usually sleep on my back and wind up on a side-it stayed in place. The light pressure felt great and was relaxing-the microbeads DID NOT shift around as some have complained. Im going to order a second NodPod to keep in a travel bag so I will never forget it. Ive been using it for the past 5 days and it has helped me get the best sleep Ive had in a long while."
'4'.'0',Beware that I found it difficult to use comfortably cause I sllep on sides,"I really do like this and I find it way better than a mask. the only reason I gave it a 4 is because I wish it were slightly wider, (the pictures make it look wider than it actually is) and softer. I love the fact it blocks out the light, the weight is perfect and its comfortable to wear when I sleep, especially if I am sleeping on my side or stomach."
'4'.'0',Didnt receive correct color,"First, I wrapped it around my shoulders and neck and think it relaxed me there. I had never seen anything like this. I gave it a try last night. I believe it helped me go to sleep faster and I awakened feeling rested. I will try again tonight."
'4'.'0',,Beware that I found it difficult to use comfortably cause I sllep on sides. If back sleeper it may be enjoyed more.
'4'.'0',"I love the lime green. Its great for a side sleeper unlike the ones with elastic. I can be in any position and still use it. Wish the pockets were a little larger and a little heavier, but I love it still. Used it during a recent MRI (not metal in the design) to help reduce stress & claustrophobia, and at the dentist to reduce the bright lights as I get migraines from them. Perfect for that and for resting/sleeping.","I bought grey, as a gift, and the person received it in black."
'4'.'0',Like a gentle hug for your face!,"Dont get me wrong.  Id buy these everyday and twice on Sunday if needed! They feel different. My husband really noticed in black,  the material feels thinner. I got pink this time. I have same issue.  Still love them. Hope the full quality comes back! Worth it though. ??"
