"Not for side sleepers. I toss and turn a lot in my sleep and they work fine as long as I am on my back. Once on my side, the speakers tend to cut into my ear. I've tried moving the speakers to different locations within the mask and still end up with my ear being very sore in the morning."
These come with a nice travel bag and are super easy to learn how to use. They are soft and make the room completely dark and comfortable around the eyes. It's probably just me but I found I had to tighten them a lot to keep them from slipping while sleeping and then I wake up with a sore nose. Also I'm a side sleeper and the earbuds in these press against my ears too much on my side. If you removed that these will get you the blackout sleep you are after. They are really comfortable around the eyes and super soft. I think they are a great deal for the price overall. I ended up moving the earbuds and just don't use them so I can sleep on my side.
"So I'm on the fence with this.On one hand, this is literally the best thing I never knew I needed. I don't think I'll ever NOT have one of these.I'm a 3rd shifter and it completely blocks out the daylight. I play storm noises or piano music and it's absolutely wonderful. NOT noise cancelling btw.The eye contours for the eyes are a must.I originally bought one that didn't have that and I had eye pain and blurred vision.The location of the controls is ideal, my original one had the controls on the side and that was ridiculous.BUT, I've been wearing this daily for 2 months and it's completely stretched out. The velcro barely matches up anymore and I only have a tiny bit that actually attaches.That's definitely a quality issue. I don't have a tiny head and I don't wear the mask tightly.At this point I have to buy a new mask because mine is actually coming off. That's really not acceptable after 2 months.Another example of poor quality control is the picture I uploaded. I had to chuckle when I saw how off centered the controls are. Does it matter? No. But it definitely demonstrates a sloppiness to the product.The ratings for this product are extremely good which seems to indicate that maybe I just got a dud."
"I am re-writing this review because the situation has changed. My original review stated that I was disappointed because after working wonderfully for about three months I could no longer charge the mask. It simply wouldn't hold a charge even when I used different chargers that were compatible. When the manufacturer offered to send a new control module to replace the old one, I decided to remove the control module and speakers and try and charge the unit while outside the mask. Somehow that worked. After fifteen minutes of charging, I decided to put the control unit back in the mask and continue charging. It worked. The mask fully charges. No more hearing ""low battery"" after plugging the mask into a charger for hours. I'll skip the manufacturer's offer to send a new control unit. I'm totally satisfied as long as it keeps charging and working."
"First, this works exactly as described.  The battery life is great, and pairing to bluetooth is easy. On mine, the lights never worked, which I am okay with.The speakers  are great! Very soft but sound good, and you cannot hear them a foot away. You have to position them just so to hear, but it's super easy.The main cons are:1 the usb cable is poorly placed. It's kinda tucked into the front, and it's not super user friendly to get to. It almost feels like an afterthought.2 the buttons are in the middle of your forehead.  They don't interfere with sleeping in any way. It just feels weird  to push on your face to change volume."
"I was really only looking for a mask to block out the ambient light while I am trying to get a little sleep at odd hours.  It does an OK job at this, although the fit is slightly wonky and requires frequent adjustment.The sound was a bonus feature as far as I'm concerned.  We're not talking Klipsch, or even Bose quality, obviously, but the cheap little things sound OK.  Better than expected at this price.My primary complaint is that speakers, cords, and controls all move around and shift out of place each time you use the mask.  I guess it's the best solution they could think of to accommodate people's varying head sizes.  🤷  It's annoying.  If they come up with a way to secure them in place once you've got them fitted properly for you, that would be terrific."
"I bought this so I could listen to relaxing music for when I sleep.  The idea is great and you can adjust it to fit, however, because my head is smaller in circumference (I guess, never really thought much of that before), the speakers end up behind my ears making it harder to hear without blasting the volume which nullifies why I wanted it.  So I would try and adjust the mask and lose the snug feeling on my head just to get a speaker in a decent area.  Also, if you're a side sleeper, while the mask itself is comfortable, the speakers hurt to lay on and you have to figure out how to adjust them for minimal pain.  I'd cut the speakers out just to have the snugness of the mask itself, but I kind of hate the idea of doing that since I'd still have the main part on the front.Overall, I guess it's great if you have a larger head than I or don't want a snug fit and are a back sleeper."
"Love these, they are perfect for quiet shutting out the world, and relaxing.  However the band stretched out quickly and now they are extremely loose we ven when tightened a much as possible."
"I give 2 stars for the ""noise cancelling"" ability.  It's only as noise cancelling as it would be if you put a wet sock over your ear.  Sound Quality get 4 stars (not bad, but we'll get to the reason in a moment).  Battery life held up very well (5 stars). The sleep mask part... kind of feels like you just taped stiff cardboard to your face with the nose cut out.  Its stiff, uncomfortable, has to sit ""just perfect"" and don't move around (if you're a side-sleeper) or it will shift and cut into the sides of your nose.  Now for the sound quality - the speakers are actually pretty good, but the placement of them is way off.  They are sewn into ""pockets"" on each ear area.  You can adjust them a bit forward or backward.  I have a slightly larger head i guess.  They move far back enough (if i smush all the way to the back), but they sit at my earlobe level, not over my ears.  If I lift the unit up so they match my ears, within minutes it'll slingshot off my head like a tight sweatband too high on the back of the head. Lastly, if you are using them while side-laying, of course THAT speaker is much MUCH louder than the other. For ASMR or music or anything, the sound is then off-balance and annoying.Summary:  If you have a small head, and don't move or breathe when sleeping, and are deaf to one side being louder than the other... Perfect!"
"Pro's and Con's to be fair.Pro's -Keeps all the light out! very effectivesoft and comfortable to wear.strap on back is adjustable and easy to adjust while on head.Con's -if your wearing it to sleep and the voice yells ""powering off"" it will wake you up.The ear speakers do not line up with my eyes so the mask is sitting at a weird angle and not comfortable, if I move the speakers up then light is getting in from the bottom, but that just may be the shape of my head.Overall, the mask is pretty good. Will keep and continue using."
wasn't charging any more after a month of use. no lights showing.
So so product. Returned it.
sound quality is fine but my ears ache in the morning from laying on the speakers. definitely not enough padding or small enough speakers to make this comfortable for a side sleeper.
"I returned this mask.  The speakers where far to close to the front.  The speakers literally rested on my temples a few inches in front of my ears.  This several reduced their noise canceling effect and worse broadcast that I was listening to, too my partner and disturbing her activities.  My wife and me have diffrent sleep schedules i go to bed earlerer and she follows with on a few hours or comes to bed at the same time but watches TV for a few hours.  If you want a product to block out both light and sound as well as allows you to listen to light music to fall asleep this is not the product for you."
"The eye rings are almost flat, was hoping to keep pressure off my eyes and sound mono. These don't sound stereo and don't handle much volume compared to my older pair. Smh"
"I've been using a different brand which was hotter to wear, so after reading some reviews I thought these may be a good upgrade for me.  I wore them one night.  The first thing I noticed what the speakers would press on my ears, because I do sleep on both sides a lot.  Also while laying on my back.....the velcro where it stuck/ joined together was to thick on the back of my head and it was uncomfortable as I could constantly feel it.  Other than that, the rest seemed to be ok.  The speakers sounded good and was easy enough to connect.  These were just not for me, one night sleep and returning them.  I'll keep looking."
"The media could not be loaded.Pros: looks nice, comes with a little a bag, can listen to relaxation music while I sleep. If you adjust it right will be pitch black.Cons: Washing mask, mine didn't come with any tool to take out ear piece or  Bluetooth module. Once I got them out it's extremely hard to put back in, once I did get it back in, doesn't stay in place. Also the straps curled up after washing.The eye part isn't as deep as I thought an it's pretty hot, wake up with sweat. Wish it was softer as well."
"I had my first of these sleep headphones for two years and loved it so much I wanted to replace it with the same thing when it stopped working. The first replacement was returned because the elastic band started to unravel after a couple of weeks. Okay, it happens so I got another of the same one to replace it. I've had this 3rd one only 5 months and it was great until the battery started to run out after a few hours. The original one lasted 8 hours plus for the whole 2 years I had it. I sleep with it every night and I when I wake in the night I want to listen until I fall asleep again, so I need it to stay charged all night. Now I wake up to find my tablet playing and my headphones dead. I'll be replacing this one with a different brand and hoping for the best."
"So I have used this mask twice and the second night I wore it a full 9 hours. The mask is comfortable, decent sound, and easy to use. HOWEVER, I didn't check my reflection in the mirror and went to work only to realize an hour into work the mask's dyes had leaked and lightly stained my face around my eyes. I looked like a bruised panda. Not sure if it's a fluke or just me. I do not use any facial creams or nighttime skin care routine. Never had a mask do this before, but it can't be healthy? I mean that is due soaking into your skin. Otherwise it works perfectly!"
"This eye mask was my saving grace for a little over a month. It drowned out my husbands snoring wonderfully! Then as of May 9th (I received it April 1st), the bluetooth function kept disconnecting from my phone. I tried multiple options in an attempt to fix it, but nothing worked. In addition to that, the head strap started to rip away from the eye mask about a week after I received it. I decided, no biggie, because I sleep on my stomach and toss and turn often. Also, that's an easy fix with a sewing kit. After the bluetooth began disconnecting itself, the mask wouldn't stay powered on. That's when I decided to give it my honest review. I ended up ordering another bluetooth eye mask from a different brand. Hoping it doesn't crap out as soon as this one did."
"The Sleep Mask with Bluetooth Headphones is an innovative product that has completely changed the way I enjoy my sleep. With its soft, comfortable mask design and built-in wireless headphones, this product provides the perfect combination of comfort and convenience!The mask itself is made with high-quality materials that are designed to block out all external light, which is perfect for those who value a good night's sleep. The Bluetooth headphones are seamlessly integrated into the mask, ensuring that you can easily drift off to sleep while listening to your favorite tunes or soothing sounds.One of the key benefits of the Sleep Mask with Bluetooth Headphones is its ability to completely eliminate the need for an external speaker or headphone setup. The headphones themselves are incredibly powerful, providing clear, high-quality sound that is perfect for relaxing or falling asleep.Overall, the Sleep Mask with Bluetooth Headphones is a fantastic product that I would highly recommend to anyone who values a good night's sleep. Whether you're looking for a new way to relax or simply want to block out external distractions, this product is the perfect way to do so!"
"Love this. I need noise playing to block out background noise and I can connect my phone to this bluetooth mask and play anything I want. It's comfortable and doesn't cause my head to sweat (a problem with other kinds of fabrics on different Bluetooth masks I've used) and it has USB C with a cable that seems much sturdier than the last version of this same device, which was Micro USB and the cable eventually broke."
"I had a pair of sleep headphones before these, but they didn't have the combined eye mask. These are perfect & so far fit very well with my CPAP. I wish they were satin, but the material is still smooth. Sound quality is fairly good, considering I'm using an app for sleep noise. Easy to control, pretty good battery life."
"I absolutely love this mask! I have had many different kinds of sleeping masks and usually find them constricting and insufficient. The elastic bands that goes across the back of the other sleeping masks I have don't seem to stay put when I am sleeping and The Mask slips down. Additionally, I noticed they let in light around my nose even before they slip.Personal note:I did not purchase this mask because it was bluetooth enabled. I purchased it because I thought the 3D eye portion (the pillow portion around the eyes preventing the masks from touching the eyes). would be more comfortable than the ones that I have tried in the past. Plus the video review by the customer gave me confidence that the light would actually be completely blocked out.I was not disappointed! The velcro in the back Is much better than elastic bands. It gently holds the mask against my face without slipping off of the back of my head. Plus, I can tighten the strap if I want to. Additionally, all the light is blocked out. This is extremely important to me and it is 100% successful. Finally, the interior 3D part of the Mask is very gentle and soothing to wear on my eyes. Unfortunately I still get hot flashes, and this mask so cool and refreshing against my skin.In order to write the review I decided to try the Bluetooth function and I am pleased to say it is a great addition. You can make the volume quite loud, but then you can hear it outside of the Mask if you do. Someone mentioned the Bulge of the earpieces possibly a problem for those who sleep on their sides, however I did not have any problems sleeping on my side. Because the ear speakers can be moved around and even removed from the mask itself, I did not find it an issue at all.  This also enables you to move see speakers around to accommodate where you would like the music to come from. If you want it directly over your ears you can move them there, or if you would rather them be more muted against your head you can move them up. They slide around inside the mask itself as separate pieces. For those that care, the mask is not noise cancelling. However, I like to listen to audible books and it does work beautifully.It was a snap to connect to my phone. You do not have to disconnect other Bluetooth devices in order to connect this. You just need to turn your Bluetooth function off before you turn on the mask. Then you can turn back on your Bluetooth function and connect the mask.I love that Amazon allows you return things that you have tried and find do not work well. I do not intend to exercise that as I sincerely love this sleeping mask."
"This product is great for light sleepers like me.  There isn't any noise canceling so you'll still be able to hear loud noises and the sound quality is not excellent, but for playing white noise or nature sounds to sleep they are great.  The bonus is that they block out the majority of light too.The battery life has been excellent.  One time I slept for 12 hours with the volume probably up around 75% and there was still at least 30% battery left.  For a normal 8 hour night it doesn't go beyond half power.The material is very soft and because the eyepiece is padded it doesn't smash your eyes.If I had one complaint it's that the little discs where the sound comes out can move around a bit during the night so sometimes I have to adjust.  But that's a small complaint.  All around I'd say this is a great product - especially for the price!"
Awesome
Really like the comfort and coolness. Ear buds are flat enough to sleep on. Can connect to phone before going to sleep and it will stay connected but I wish I could start music with one of the buttons on the mask so I don't have to use the phone in the middle of the night.
"The eye mask part is great. Completely blocks out any light and very comfortable to wear. Also, the earbud parts are easy to move around so that I can hear better no matter how I'm wearing the mask. Love it!"
Okay so upon original impression I thought this did not fit my head. BUT the speakers are easily moveable inside the band and can be adjusted to sit anywhere you'd like. So this does indeed fit I would say most head types. Really cool product and the sound quality is good. I wish it got a little bit louder though as I am planning on wearing this to help me sleep at a music festival. I think it will still do a great job though. Super comfy and light weight as well!
"Got it because i get really bad migraines and have taken to listening to soft asmr or my audio-book while also needing something to completely block out the [evil] light.This product happened to be on sale at the time and so it was a bit of a panic/ ""i didn't think too much about it"" buy. partly because the idea struk me as i was in pain and just wanted something to entertain me while i was in pain on the bathroom floor....***ahhem...when i got it i found out i could ANSWER THE PHONE WITH IT TOO!  that was an awesome bonus - but i let the people most appt to call me that if they did while i was in pain that i would put their head in a vice.... (we share pain in my family). so i have not had the chance to test that feature.I've had it for a few months now and its soft and nice.the only complaint i'd really have is the speakers don't align with my ears....i had no idea my head was that small....or oddly shaped for that matter...I found out quite a lot about my head with these things.(at least i'm not totally ugly, so there's that).anyway, i DO recommend these.  You can always turn the volume up a little to hear what you need and such if the speakers start slipping.  All in all, i've slept with them and they are soft and comfy.  do NOT recommend if you're doing hair treatments tho....one or the other....fyi....(saw what it did to someone elses....was not pretty....nor did it smell good....)but yeah....i think that's everything....this really is the perfect mid-day napping agent."
Nice size. Issues: taking the headphones and charger is a big chore to take out before washing. The holes to push them through are really tiny. In order to use them to sleep you have to take the charger out. Afraid it will break the wires. So I have taken the system out to use only the mask itself. Back to square one using headphones 🎧 to sleep.
"I bought this before a cross-country flight, hoping to use it for sleeping with background movie/music (helps me to fall asleep in any situation). Unfortunately the quality and volume of sound isn't sufficient on an airplane, so I could barely hear anything. I ended up just using it as a sleep mask, and tucking my regular earbuds underneath for the flight. Works better if you're in a silent place like a hotel, I guess? Neat concept, but they should make one with noise-canceling technology; as I assume others will be hoping to use these on airplanes. Or at the very least, make the volume LOUDER to hear over that noise."
"Even with the phone set to silent, it announces calls and what number is calling. This actually woke me up while I was sleeping with them on. Also, if I have an alarm set on my phone it still goes off through the phone even with the unit attached to Bluetooth. Part of the reason I got this was to travel with other people so I don't disturb them with my alarms. The way that the ear phones are put into the mask, they are not adjustable and don't line up with my ears properly. They also pressed against my head when sleeping on my side, so these are not good for side sleepers. Although the mask itself is fairly comfortable, and I do like the space it has for your eyes and how much light it blocks out, I will be returning it because of the other issues"
"This mask was very comfortable to sleep in. HOWEVER, the wiring is very lightweight and although I tried to be careful tucking it in after charging, it broke in half after only 6 months. Unfortunately you can't order replacement earphones, you're left ordering a whole new mask."
I liked these but they have decided to stop working after only 8 months. My previous set lasted 3 years and only stopped working because they got caught in the sheet and throw in the washer. I thought these would last longer
But now it no longer charges. 😔
It works but do you want to sleep with an explosive battery on your face?
"For my opinionPros:- comfortable and soft on the face- easily adjustable because of the velcro strap- pairs easily on my samung phone- sound quality is good- volume adjustment is good- volume control is perfect at its position especially if you move too much while sleepingCons:- speakers are a little thick and hard (would feel like there is a stack of coins) which kills my ear in the morning being a side sleeper- this cheap so there is definitely no noise cancellation or noise reductionAt the price, it is acceptable but not recommendable especially for side sleepers. I tried all kinds of pillows on this to ""cushion"" the hardness of the speakers but I still wake up with a painful ear. If you sleep on your stomach then you are fine with this.What will make this perfect next time?Use a softer and slimmer speaker like the ones used by Accoustic sheep sleepphones or something even better than that. If that happens, I will buy everyone I know with it.I think a rating of 3 stars is appropriate at this time."
"If I position it low enough to actually fit over my ears, it pinches the top of my nose and I can't breathe very well. So it's definitely not made for everyone."
"I was eagerly awaiting my mask....Simple set up...Until I put on...the headphones are so far back tat I can barely hear the music...the headphones position can not be moved...tightening the mask still does not help...sadly, had to return............"
i listen to guided sleep meditations (Jason Stephenson is a G! love his stuff!) and binaural beats to sleep. these are best experienced with headphones so i decided to get these. my husband is also a heavy snorer so i needed something to drown out the noise.cons:- volume doesn't go loud enough- the L sided headphone quit working 9 months in. i'm past the customer service window 🙄- they're slightly too big for my head- i often get a sore spot on my ear if i'm laying on my side.- difficult to washpros:- my first set— i lost the charger and cust service sent me whole new headphones & were supportive. apparently there's a window of time you can contact them though (stupid)- i work pretty much steady nights so i like that i can drown out noise & light!- battery time is pretty decent.this time i'm getting the headband one in hopes it fits my head better.
"I've used similar products in the past and loved them, but this one fell a little short. They're very comfy, the sound quality is great. There's just two big issues I have. First, when you get a phone call, the robot lady voice loudly announces to you that you've got an incoming call and reads off the number - with past products I've tried, an incoming call would briefly pause the sound, which was much less jarring. Second, when your alarm goes off in the morning, it does NOT play through the headphones (like I expected it to from past experiences). Noise cancellation is pretty good so my alarm went off for a bit before I realized. I'll give them a few more nights to try to get used to them since the sound quality is really nice, but I'm a little disappointed by the drawbacks."
"I love the comfort and feel of these!  The only problem I have is that every time I use them (unless I just used them in the last half hour), I have to manually connect to the bluetooth on my phone...it won't do it automatically.  Also, it doesn't automatically turn itself off, so if I fall asleep with them on, it keeps using the battery all night long and then some, if I don't remember to manually turn them off when I wake up."
"I use this nightly and really like it.  Even at a fairly loud volume, the sound is contained and my partner can't tell when I am listening to music.  The velcro at the back does get caught in my hair, and the three button control panel moves around a bit too easily, but I could fix that with an extra stitch or two to hold it in place.  It charges quickly and other than the velcro issue is pretty comfortable.  I can even wear it with my CPAP."
"I like that it charges with USB-C. I wear musical eye masks with earplugs so I need a louder volume and I have other musical eye masks that get louder but they are pretty comfortable to sleep with, not too much pressure on the ear when you are on your side."
Good sound and say to use.  Painful on ears if you sleep on your side with it directly under your ear.
"The power and volume controls are conveniently placed at the front and top of the mask making it super easy to operate the mask, especially if you're using it at night. Adjustable wrap and extra padding around the eyes makes the fit of the mask extra comfortable.My only complaint is that some of the dyes rubbed off on our white sheets… I'm guessing this might be because I shower before bed so some of it might have rubbed off when my hair was wet and would press against the material.Overall, great product and would recommend to anyone looking to sleep more comfortably and soundly."
"I bought these headphones as I like to fall asleep to music, but my partner is a light sleeper and does not. They work really well to shut out light and extraneous noise. However, as a side sleeper, my only complaint is that the speakers can begin to cause discomfort to my ears from laying on the plastic speaker inside the mask, all night. The speakers also tend to slip around inside the sleeves on the side, so I always have to slightly reposition them, every night, before I use the mask. But overall a good product!"
"I sleep with a CPAP mask so this thing was a poor fit for me as the eye mask is too big for my CPAP mask to fit comfortably. My boyfriend enjoys using it though. I have a similar pair that I use to listen to ASMR.This pair lacks the function that allows me to switch videos at the push of a button while my old pair had it.They do a good job at blocking out light and the sound quality is good, but if you use a CPAP mask this will not be a good fit for you."
"This product definitely helps to reduce sound, but it does not completely eliminate external noise. Perhaps this is due to the sound of my annoying, yowling cat. If you are merely trying to reduce the sound of the your neighborhood or someone snoring, this might be effective. In addition, it is rather comfortable."
"Works fine.  Power cable will probably break because it is so thin.I bought this one because the last one I had was similar and the power cable was the first to wear out.Easy to use.  Fabric feels fine.Sound quality is pretty good, but the speakers are too wide for it to be super comfortable.Made for smaller heads.  I don't have a big head and it barely fits.It is okay.  Not as good as the one that is about to break in some ways, better in others.It is frustrating because there are so many random sleep masks and they all suck in different ways.It is okay, but kinda isn't.  When it falls apart in I'll buy a new one…. Made well, but again I expect the power adapter to fail at some point.That is all."
"I found the eye mask to be comfortable over the eyes, but was too warm to wear.  I was actually sweating under the eye mask.  The earphones were difficult to actually place over the ears, no matter how I adjusted, but the sound quality was good  I was disappointed that they caused such a build-up of heat as the design is what I wanted and I could have accepted the other issue with the earphones."
"As someone who has a hard time falling asleep without noise, I was hopeful this product would be the solution to all my problems.1. I no longer annoy my husband with my videos playing all night.2. Less light exposure to my eyes for more restful sleep.3. Cancel out any other noise that may be going on (I'm a light sleeper).However, I am a small-headed individual, and this product was not intended for small noggins.The speakers go too far back on my head so they are behind my ears, giving me little to no noise canceling. This also has the volume at perpetually too quiet to hear even at max volume because they're not on my ear. And the tightest I can make it still has it sliding off my head and leaves a gap between my eyes and the mask, so light gets let in.3 strikes, you're out. I tried to put up with it for a few nights but it just wasn't helpful. Back to the drawing board for me.I gave it a 3 star review because for the right head size, this may be a really great product. Unfortunately, until they offer different sizes, it simply does not work for me."
"I have some really awful tinitus so I can't sleep well without sound. It's comfortable, and works very well for blocking out light, but the headset part is an issue. The speakers in the sides move too easily and I have to constantly readjust them so they line up with my ears. Being a device for sleep, I think it's weird that it doesn't auto shut-off after it's not been used for a time. I set my music on a sleep timer so it stops after 30 minutes, but I have to manually turn it off, so the battery drains in a couple nights and I have to recharge it often. I'm not crazy picky, so I'm keeping it. Just a heads up for people who might be more particular."
"PROS:-Good (almost total) Light Blocking-Good Sound Quality-VERY Comfortable, Even for Side SleepersCON:-Battery Life Degrades Quickly, down to 4 hours on a full charge after just 3.5 monthsFirst off, I love the design and comfort of this sleep mask.  It is super soft and stays cool.  The padding around the eyes, and the recessed holes where your eyeballs are make it very comfortable.  The strap is comfortable on your ears and back of the head.I'm a side-sleeper, so I was a little worried about having to lay on the speakers, but the position of the speakers is adjustable and I had no problem finding a good spot for them that was both comfortable and produced great sound quality.They are very easy to pair with a Bluetooth device.  I paired them with my iPad once, and now as soon as I turn it on, it connects.  Since I use it for sleeping, I didn't like it notifying me of my phone ringing, which is why I swapped it over to my iPad.  I can't really review that feature, except to say it worked well enough for me to need to swap away from my phone.Now... the downfall of this product: Battery life.  I have owned the mask for about 3.5 months.  When this product arrived, it worked as advertised: 2 hours charge time gave me 10 hours of battery life.  But very quickly I started to lose battery life.  After 3.5 months, even a full charge will only get me 4 hours of battery life.  It's really frustrating because other than this, I absolutely LOVE this mask.  I'm now looking for a new set of sleep headphones, but I'm still going to take the electronics out of these and keep it as a regular sleep mask because it's so darn comfy."
"Bought this for my girlfriend because I snore, apparently rather loudly. She really liked it and said it did actually drown out the noise of my snoring.She has been using it for about 3 months, but it has stopped taking a charge.  Trying to see if I can get in touch with the company to see about a warranty of some sort. Hopefully they will send a replacement, but just be aware it seems the quality is not good"
I have a small head so that sometimes I can actually wear kids hats. So this thing wrapped so far around my head that the speakers were behind my ears.  Great idea and sad to say I had to return.
"This headphone mask is great for sleep, super comfy. And the speakers can but adjusted. It lasts about three days per charge. The only downside I have found is if the battery is close to dying while you are wearing it, it yells ""low battery"" waking you from deep sleep. Is there a reason it needs to tell you? I can see the battery life on my phone. I don't need it to yell at me."
This is a good product with the exception of the way it fits. I have an average size Female head and the Velcro fasteners to hold it on did not do a very good job as far as sizing goes. It keeps slipping off. Guess I will have to make some modifications on it and sew it to fit me a little more snugly. The sound quality is good. It has two small round speakers on each side that move within the inside of the Mask. You can slide them with your fingers to position them where you want them. They are located under soft fabric. This mask does not cancel noise very well. I could still hear my Husband typing on his Computer while I was laying on Bed. There are only a few strips of material and a speaker between you and the outside World. I am a side sleeper and I was able to position them in such a way where it was pretty comfortable. It does black out the light fairly well. I had to position in on my nose far down for it to do so and it blocked my breathing from my nose so I had to move it up a bit which let in some light from the bottom if the mask. I do feel like I feel asleep faster with this. I did take it off in the middle of the night but it helped me FALL asleep and that's what matters. For the price its a good buy.
The sleep mask is extremely effective at blacking out anyway light. It is mostly comfortable & will hold a charge for 8+hrs. My only issues are that the Bluetooth speakers can be felt w/o weight on it but if you sleep on your side it will get annoying at times. The last/ biggest problem is that it dyed my face purple. It came off w/ toner but it was still there for weeks after. I'm not even sure if I would repurchase it. Just proceed with caution.
"I have used sleep masks my whole adult life and love the Bluetooth ones because I can listen to bedtime stories or meditations on them. I've tried a wide variety of Bluetooth sleep masks, but never fails, none of them ever fit my head. The Velcro is always too big and I wind up needing to alter it or tie it in knots to hold it on my head. THIS IS THE FIRST mask that the Velcro actually fits me on. I am elated after soooo many different brands I have wasted money on for so many years. Easily 10-15 just from Amazon. I already saved this to my cart so I will never forget which brand to get from now on.I love the color and softness of the mask as well. It's very soft and breathable and I love the eye indents because I have permenant false lashes and this allows them to not get damaged and crunched up when I wear a mask.These are also amazing for migraines, the feeling of a ""head hug"" really feels wonderful. I suffer from chronic migraines, and this is a great tool in my toolbox.My most wholehearted 5 stars!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Never slept so deep. It takes away all distractions and fits great
"I had a prior model that gave up after a few years of use, so I went back for another.The front mask is sized large enough to create a firm light seal around my face. Near total darkness even when my wife has the lights on.The speakers broadcast right over my ear so my white noise is ahead of anything external. I have very bad tinnitus. I need the white noise louder than the ringing but not so much that it keeps me awake.  The on-mask volume control helps me adjust to the correct level.The Velcro strap provides an infinite sizing around the head.I like the new USB-C charging port.  It's much more sturdier than the prior model.I had to go a few weeks without this style mask because I ordered an incorrect one then had to do the return and reorder thing.  Those nights were hell.I am back to being sound asleep and feeling so much better in the morning."
"I've liked this sleeping head-set. I found the quality, charging, shape, color very exellent."
The fit is soft and comfortable. The sound is amazing. It puts me in a whole other world.
This sleep mask helps me sleep so I can listen to my ASMR!
These have done a great job blocking out any outside light when my eyes are especially sensitive due to Migraine. I haven't slept with them on for more than a couple of hours before removing them because I tend to feel claustrophobic with any part of my face covered more than a short while. I have a large head and was happy with the length the straps were able to expand to. I have not connected to music (yet) but these are still worth it for me.
"I really love this sleep mask.  I have been wearing eye masks and earplugs with an air purifier and sometimes noisy fan to drown out any noises by my husband or dog since I am a very light sleeper.  I recently bought another sleep mask which is fine to use when he is not around, but then I saw that there were other masks with sound built-in so I looked around and this mask had good reviews and had the 3D eye holes which I wanted.  I have been using this mask pretty much daily and am very happy with this product.  The mask is comfortable and blocks the light for me.I use an iPhone and a White noise app listening to a ""Stream water flowing"" when I sleep.  I do notice that you need to have the Bluetooth device close by.  One night my husband moved my phone to the other side of our king-sized bed so I could sleep in and not hear the alarm as he was going to wake up with the kids instead and  the sound kept getting interrupted and ""sputter"" with silence in between like a bad connection which ended up waking me up.  So now I use an old phone strictly meant to provide the white noise sound.  I tried a really old ipod touch but it only provided sound in one year so that didn't work especialy because it was the left ear that didn't sound and that is the side my husband sleeps!  Also, be careful when charging that you don't pull the wire out too much as the audio unit inside gets misplaced and you have to maneuver it back to the right position.I was able to move the earphone parts so it covers my ears fine.  I do still wear earplugs as well as I am used to it and it helps keep extra noise out.I had some questions after purchasing and they got back to me very quickly which was nice.I keep the mask charged when I am not using it and it lasts me a very long time as I like to sleep!  After the kids go to school sometimes I go back to sleep and the mask still lasts as long as I nap even with the small charge in between.Again very happy with this sleepmask."
Description was very accurate. Product works great.
"I do love these.  When I want to sleep in the daytime but still need to listen to music or a podcast, these are the best.  And being able to control the volume on my forehead is simple and easy.  Only issue is the ears are not static, but I just move them to where I need them and keep it moving."
I mainly use mine for dry eye protection. With a ceiling fan blowing at night this mask helps keep the air from hitting my eyes. You do know during the night you eye lids open at a rapid pace while you sleep? The music works nice also.
"I am such a light sleeper and really struggle with falling asleep when the house is so quiet. I have used numerous sleeping headphones/headbands over the years. I use them until they don't charge anymore, or just completely wear out. This was my first sleep mask with headphones, I've never bothered with sleep masks, but I love this! It doesn't put any pressure on those gentle baby hairs along your forehead, is adjustable with a Velcro strap, doesn't hurt to sleep on your side, the sound quality is exactly what I need for sleeping. Easy to remove the electronic portions and toss in the wash. The material that covers your eyes and nose is so super soft. There are times I will forget to charge the mask and it will last at least 3 full nights of sleep on a charge. I am so pleased with this purchase and tell all my friends who have to share a bed with someone who snores to immediately buy one!"
"Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit us in 2020 I have been experiencing insomnia caused from stress. Worried about how this virus would affect my loved ones and myself.  I bought this sleep mask over a year ago as a secret Santa gift for a friend and I decided to buy another for myself.I just decided to use it for the first time on January 8th of this new year 2023 and I got my first full night's sleep in 2 years. This mask is amazing. The speakers are great and the fact that I can control what volume I can fall asleep with was just great. The Bluetooth capabilities is wonderful because I can connect it to either my phone or my Alexa devices and I set it to sleep sounds of ""the rainforest, ocean, rain, or any soothing sound"". The mask is super comfortable on my face and it has an adjustable strap in the back to fit it snugly or loosely on your face. I liked it snug so it blocks out all lights. It's perfect when my husband is still awake watching TV and the light doesn't bother me because it's blocked out completely. It has a charging port that I plug in every morning and it holds a charge for over 8 hours so It basically runs all through the night uninterrupted.I feel well rested and recharged every morning after a GREAT night's sleep. I know what I will be giving my best friend for her birthday this year….yep, this sleep mask (not mine). I will order one for her 😀I love, love, love this mask and I will not be leaving home without it EVER!!"
"This is my 2nd purchase of this product. The first time I purchased was several years ago and I use ot every night.It washes well, is easy to rethread the electronics, the speakers are narrow enough that they are not bothersome, and the sound is good."
Love it so far! Planing to use it on overnight flights!
"Total blackout and comfortable. Excellent purchase. I got this for my husband who was moved back to third shift and struggles with daytime sleeping. Much simpler option than blacking out windows and sawing cat door in bedroom door (excessive pawing at door if closed is worse than light).He can sleep comfortably on his back or side and doesn't rip it off in the middle of sleeping like some do apnea masks, etc. Very comfortable to wear. I can turn the ceiling light off and on and he can't even tell. No light leakage at edges or corners of the mask.The velcro is a nice fine grain that's sewn on well. It also comes with a little cloth strip over the velcro to cover the rougher unused section (more showing for larger heads) so it won't stick or snag on pillow/sheets. It's a simple piece of cloth, so you can put it over just the part not covered by the other piece of velcro or remove entirely. Simple but nice touch not usually seen on velcro band items.Have tried listening to music, good speakers. Easy to connect to iPod. Great sound and volume. Like the ability to adjust and slide the speakers to individual ear locations for varying head sizes. Not sure about battery life, lasted for at least a few hours, because he needs to find/purchase some music/sounds/white noise/etc. that will work better for him to sleep though. Some soft classical piano was excellent to fall asleep with and it appeared to work well as designed, but an unfortunate louder piano section an hour or two later actually woke him back up. Haven't tried again since, and won't until we find more compatible sleeping sounds for him. It doesn't block out a lot of sound without music playing, but very good with music playing.Easy to charge, and charging light changed from red to blue when fully charged. The bag included was a little smaller than I thought it should be, it squished the main mask part a little, but is a nice addition and still appears to work well. I also like how the charging cord tucks back into the mask completely, with an overlapping flap so it won't fall out or press against your face, you don't know it's there.It's so nice and comfortable that he even wears when sleeping when it's dark to block out ambient light in the room.Looking forward to finding him some good white noise sounds to block noise out as well as it does the light.He is recommending to his fellow 3rd shift workers. While it can't fix all the issues of third shift, it's a win in the light category, and hopefully the sound. All indications are that the sound will also be a win when we can find the right music/audio."
"Love the material, I was worried that the headphones might project the sound beyond the person wearing them, but they don't! Really happy with these."
"Battery lasts the night, sometimes gets a little warm due to fabric but easy to connect good product"
"I dotn like blindfolds but this keeps pressure off your eyes. I put on a medication, mask up and go to sleep. Game changer!"
They work get. Help me fall asleep faster. I use it every night M-F.
"The eyes are kind of close, it rubs my eyelashes and it won't stay up on my head"
"They were comfortable at first but I am a side sleeper and it is very bulky.  Although there are cushions around the eyes, they move around and the Velcro's in the back is very uncomfortable.  Not for sleeping in bed, maybe just sitting up like in a plane.  Always adjusting them during my sleep, so not helpful in that retrospect."
"I really liked how comfy it was around my face, but for some reason when I wake up I'm drenched in sweat. Also, it causes this very painful pain on the upper part of my ears. But other than that sound is good, blocks any lightings."
"I bought and tried out three masks of this type.  This one was NOT the winner.  Here's a comparison between the three:1st mask: Lightimetunnel / Watogafer2nd mask: LC-dolida / Enjoying3rd mask: Boodlab (WINNER!)AUDIO:The first mask had audio that kept cutting out at the start of bit of talking during a podcast, such that I kept missing words.  The second and third masks didn't have that problem, thank goodness.  However, the trade off was that the audio quality on both the second and third ones was that they had tinny sound.  However, since I apparently had to choose between that or missing words, I chose the tinny quality.  It wasn't awful, since I'm just listening to podcasts, but if I was listening to something musical, I don't think I would have been at all satisfied with it, though.STRAP:The strap on the first two masks I tried was way too long, and the velcro kept catching on my hair because so much of it was exposed  from the adjustment on the strap.  And even then I couldn't really get it snug enough to stay in place.  The third one, however, had no velcro, and instead had an adjustable elastic slide.  MUCH better system, and I was able to get it perfectly snug.LIGHT BLOCKING, COMFORT:All three masks were excellent at light-blocking, and were very comfortable on the eyes.  This style of sleep mask, with the doughnut-shaped gel cushion around the eyes and the little flap over the nose, really can't be beat.  I'll never use another style of sleep mask again, audio or no audio."
This is my second pair of sleep headphones (two different brands) that have stopped  working because of broken wires. I wish they'd make the wire coating thicker so it would be more durable... other than that it's fine
On my 4th night of using these I turned them on to connect and they worked fine and the music cut off and I thought it paused but it had turned off after a little bit of this I thought they were just dead so I plugged them in and had them plugged in from 7am to 11pm and they were still doing that
"Was delivered May 12th, not even a month later, the Bluetooth stopped working. It'll connect for a few seconds and then turn off. I even charged it all day while I was at work; nothing. . Hopefully I can contact the seller and have it replaced. The mask itself is comfortable, though."
"This is a good addition to my sleep aids for insomnia, once I learned to live with its design flaws. But, given how hyper-sensitive a person with insomnia is likely to be to sound, should I have to accept that?  I almost returned it after my first use. It's clear that the designer didn't use the product for a week, nor test it out in a real-life context, as a good designer should. I suspect it was designed by an engineer.  The most frustrating experience is the alert sounds--in order to adjust the volume, one has to hold down the up or down (+ or -) button. Yet, when you get to the max or minimum volume there are three full volume, very harsh electronic beeps. This defeats the purpose of relaxing and calming the mind for sleep. To make it more frustrating, there's no reason for it. It is obvious when you reach the max or minimum volume. One doesn't need to be alerted with a beep. Beeps are the bane of our electronic world. Again, why didn't they try using the product themselves? By doing that, one finds issues you didn't think of at the drawing board.In addition, there is a voice saying ""Power on""  ""connected""  and ""power off.""  These alerts were obviously meant to be heard while holding the item, not with it on the head. They are also at full volume and startling if turned on or off while wearing it. If the battery goes dead while sleeping, you may be woken with a loud voice saying  ""power off.""I'm keeping it though. It's good for the price. I've learned to be careful when adjusting the volume as I got the feel of it and usually can avoid the three beeps. It does let some light through and I can fix that with a needle and thread. With a few simple improvements that would cost almost nothing to implement, this would be an awesome sleep product."
"The product is brillient.  Everyone needs something like this.  It blocks out light such as clocks, charging leds, or street lights and allows you to listen to whatever you need to fall asleep without disturbing anyone else sharing a space with you.Be aware, while the mask blocks bright light, your skin does not.  It is still bright in mid day because of that.  Also, It has fallen off my head every morning, so dont trust it for alarms.unfortunatly this product has problems.  The bluetooth controlls are backward in every way.  + and - are on the oposite side as they are on literly every other device, and a short click seeks your audio where a long press adjusts audio.  this is extra problematic since long pressing pause turns it off.it has a very thin usbc charging cable that tends to break in about 9 months.Its biggest problem is that it has a very loud and very annoying voice.  you will be just drifting off when it will yell at you LOW BATTERY!!! or when you hit the minimum volume, it will BEEEEP at seamingly the maximum volume.All of these problems are fixed on other rival products in this markey, but I still order this one occasionaly for 1 key reasonThis is the only mask I have found that is large enough.So now what I tend to do, is order this one, and a better one, and frankenstine together 1 5 star mask out of this mask, and the other's electronics.  This works great!  But the speaker cables do eventually break."
"It does what it says, it blocks the light really well. The sides that go over the ear has speakers and wires, and when you sleep over it your ears will hurt when you wake up. The mask itself is too hard, not soft or plush."
"I was hoping that I would be able to fall asleep listening to a story or mediation without disturbing my husband. But I found the on/off control button and the volume control 'buttons' very difficult to use.  I had to keep taking the mask off, turn on the light, adjust the volume control and then replace the mask. And I just didn't find it easy to fall asleep because the small speakers, in the ear cushions, could still be felt. Also, i learned that the in order to wash the mask, periodically, I would have to remove the small speakers, the connecting wiring, and the control mechanism; and then replace it all again--once it had been washed and thoroughly dried.  I will however use this face mask during the day, when i want to meditate!"
It'll make your ears a little sore in the morning if you're a side sleeper but the battery lasts all night and the audio quality is decent.
Don't like the strap with Velcro. Doesn't stay in place while sleeping.
"Update:  Changing my review from 1 star to 3 stars.  The seller reached out to me and sent me replacement electronics to install.  This product is now working again.  I will update again should these electronics last more than 100 days or go the other way.As others have said, the power off notification is loud and unnecessary. I liked these but as others have said, they stop working after an unreasonably short length of time. For me, coincidentally it was long enough so that I couldn't return it as it was past 90 days. Buyer beware and know that your $25 will get you 100 or so days with a non-functioning hunk of junk."
"I bought this eye mask because I get headaches and migraines frequently and I needed something that totally blacks everything out and plays soothing music. This eye mask is great for blacking out the world. That is the very best!!!However, although the Bluetooth works great and has great sound and great battery life, I have found that the speakers are too bulky. I wake up often with my ears hurting because the speakers are hard and bulky. If there was a way (which I'm sure there is) to make the speakers more flat and softer, this would be the absolute perfect thing. Also, the sound keeps cutting out ever 30 seconds or so which is annoying when you are trying to listen to music. That is the only reason why I had to give it 3 stars."
"Unique design, but unfortunately just not worth it. The silent cancelation is next to barely noticeable. Comfort is great. Fits fine. Quality otherwise is superb."
I thought that these sleep headphones were perfect until after I washed them.Pros:* block all light* sound quality is good* enough room so that my eyelashes didn't hit the fabric* great for side sleeping* buttons work wellCons* Washed it by hand following the instructions and then it started leaving black marks on my pillow.I didn't notice at first because my pillowcases at home are dark. Then we stayed at a hotel and what you see in the photo happened. The cleaning staff probably thought I had a bad dye job and was sweating out color Rudy Giuliani style.That was enough reason to toss them! So sad... loved them.
"This problem will probably only affect side sleepers, such as myself. But as soon as I laid on my side, the speakers felt like barbed wire to my ears. There was absolutely NO cushion protection to soften the hard plastic.I've owned a similar pair of Bluetooth nightmask, and what I had to do was now insert/wrap a tiny type of foam around the speaker (the type of foam they put around microphones on a headset).Yeah, the music was a little muffled, but at least I was comfortable.And speaking of music, the volume was pretty loud too, even on the lowest settings. Some people that have sensitive hearing at night may find problems with that.Another inconvenience I have is that- let's say that I set my music app to sleep mode in 2 hours. When the app closes, instead of the mask device detecting that my phone is off and there's no music playing, it'll just stay on the whole night. Kind of inconvenient if I have to charge it every other night."
Works great! However it turns your face blue.
This was just to large. It covers to much of your face and it doesn't block out the light.
Item is comfortable and sound is great. Only down fall is product would not charge after have around 6 months.
"These were inexpensive enough I'd give them a go.They do eliminate all light. No matter how you shake it if you put something on your head when you sleep your head's gonna get hot. No way around this. Not so bad in this category.Regarding sound quality - not nearly as good as my Kurdene S8 ear buds (which I've purchased four pairs of just in case). In any event, sound quality doesn't have to be perfect but good enough so long as they are comfortable.They do have a Velcro head band so you can position them where you like then seal the Velcro and they stay on sufficiently.The problem is if you tighten them enough for side sleeping so they don't scooch around on your head then they smash your ears. I or I should say, they smash my ears. After two nights of sleeping with them the third night my ears hurt so bad I couldn't wear them and haven't since. I may try them again like I said great in theory but not so great in practice.You may have better results - my ears are very sensitive."
I've had chronic insomnia since I was a small child. I use this product with sound therapy. It helps me relax and get to sleep a lot quicker when I'd otherwise possibly not fall asleep at all. The velcro keeps getting stuck in my hair though. It hurts.
"Very comfortable and easy to use, but product volume doesn't get as loud as I'd like."
"This sleep mask has helped me to fall asleep pretty much anywhere, any time. It blocks the light so well and I can listen to an audiobook or podcast without disturbing my boyfriend. The only negative is that if I sleep on my side, the speaker starts to hurt up against my ear, so I have to maneuver it a certain way or else I'll wake up with a sore ear. Does not happen when I sleep on my back though, obviously."
"Really happy with the price and what you get. Sound is great, blocks out light. Ear buds can be adjusted thru material. Ears do get sore if you sleep on your side"
"This is my second pair of this type of headphones and overall they are excellent. 1: They are comfortable to wear while sleeping and the sound quality is decent. 2:The adjustable headband works well but would benifit from a way to tuck in the extra for smaller heads so that it doesn't tangle hair or ball up while sleeping. 3: They hold a charge well and usually last for about 2 nights before I have to recharge. 4: The biggest problem I've had with these is the durability of the cable that connect to the charger. It is a very small gauge and pulling it out and (carefully) tucking it back in tends to break at this point before any other components wear out over time.Overall, I love them and will continue to buy again as needed."
"I work over nights so my sleep schedule is during the day. The light blocking of the mask is perfect,  it fits snugly but feels so light I can hardly tell it's there.  It's easy to pair with your phone and the sound quality,  while not great,  is just fine for me as I use it for sleep/meditation/binaural sync type music to aid in my sleep.The only con about this is that it doesn't auto shut off when you're Playlist ends... but the charge levels have lasted me 3 night before I bothered recharging it and had no issues,  so I think it does go into a sort of idle state...Regardless, this works, is comfortable and really does let you sleep on your side without pressure on or in your ears at all like conventional headphones would.  Recommend."
"I have enjoyed this product so far.  I always wear a sleep mask, but this one is really good if you like to listen to music as you go to sleep."
Great product. Clean audio for stories or sounds. A little warm if worn too long.
"This eye mask functioned perfectly. Charged fine, paired easily with my phone, and the sound quality was good enough to fall asleep with white noise or whatever.  BUT, I have a tiny little kid size head, and the location of the earbuds inside the mask landed behind my ears. I was sad because they were soft and completely blacked out the light. I am a day sleeper because of shift work, and that part was great. I'm passing them to a friend with a normal size head. They work great, but they just didn't fit, and there's no way to adjust the position of the speaker inside the mask. That's why I knocked off a star."
"This is a comfortable, not hot sleep mask, which is hard to come by. Even with the headphones in, it's comfortable for side-sleeping. I will say that I had to let out a couple stitches so I could remove the headphones to wash the mask (see photos), but it was easy to do. I wish the ""connected"" voice notification was much softer and I also wish the Velcro strap was easier to adjust for a small head. I'm going to have to cut off the ""tail"" of it. Otherwise, I'm pleased and feel like it was worth it. I even had a problem with the initial headphone not staying connected, but the seller sent a new one right away and everything works well! It's perfect for me to listen to a ""sleep story"" without disturbing my husband or letting the cats know I'm still kinda awake ha ha!"
"This is my third mask. The first two had problems with the cords. The first one was years ago and the cable started to fray and I got worried so I bought a new one. The second one I reinforced the cable, but one of the speakers blew. This third one, the charge cable was much thinner and not as rigid and so far doesn't seem as fragile. This one is also USB-C, which I personally appreciate. Lastly, no it's not noise cancelling. It can get loud enough to drown out sounds, but that's volume, not noise cancelling.UPDATE:So, downgraded review. The thinner, less rigid cable finally broke. I had it taped up with super tough tape and it kept breaking at the tape. It surprisingly still worked, but wouldn't charge anymore. So I'm not buying a new one. I bought flat headphones and a tiny bluetooth reciever and replaced the mask's insides. I don't have to worry about the cables being so thin and frail. So far, I love it. The reciever doesn't get in the way and I can't feel it at night."
Feels comfortable while sleeping. Bluetooth function works well.
I've had 3 pairs and the only complaint I have is where you plug in to charge the wires eventually will break
"I really don't prefer writing negative reviews, but this product is a bit difficult to use. The back velcro strap is, for some reason, angled down so that the mask is held together under the base of the skull. I didn't the this was a big deal, but every time I wear it, within minutes, it slides down off my face and becomes a necklace. Other wise, the audio works great and the material quality is excellent."
Nice to listen to music at nightCover from most of the light and brightnessNot comfortable in the earsSpeakers keen movingAfter a while it makes the face itchyStop using it because not sure how to watch without destroying  the speakers batteries~~Always count on me for honest review~~
its good but hurts when you sleep side
It works and my wife does not hear the meditation I'm listening to to get me back to sleep. I'm getting used to the devices fit. All in all happy with it all.
"I bought this product to use when I start traveling on long flights but I decided to test try it at home before traveling to get used to it, now I use it on a continual basis.  During the Christmas holidays the mask fit around my eyes comfortable enough to where with them open they were not bothered and still light was not able to come in.  I wear a CPAP most nights and the mask fit over the mask comfortably enough to where I didn't feel encumbered wearing it.  Those nights that I wasn't streaming music to sleep by, the earphones cancelled out most noise in the household good enough that I wasn't bothered by it, the only problem I encountered was controlling the volume on the mask, the switches under the pad would not connect all the time, if you're going to be wearing this full time and using the speakers to listen to music or whatever, I would recommend charging the mask about every two days.  I had no trouble synching the mask with both my tablet and phone."
"I used it just one night and will return it. The product comes without any seal so I really hope they will not just sell it to anyone else as I used it one night and it certainly got some sweat. Because it comes with no seal I also hope i did not get a unit that was used by anyone else.This said I saw three big flaws in this item:- it blocks zero noise, nothing- it is really uncomfortable. If you are a side sleeper this thing will press your ears and you will get sore all day- last and this one was perhaps the one that made me determined to return. I used it with Calm, and fell asleep nicely. I must have started using it around 11:30pm. When it was 5:45am this thing ran out of battery than announced in my ears ""POWER OFF"". It is a loud announcement, trust me! I woke-up and never more fell asleep last night."
"Worked great for 8 months, now the charging cord is frayed and can't be safely used any more. I do wish the volume adjustment was a bit more precise. Held a good charge."
The nose area is definitely not cut high up like the picture shows.  Because of this light filters through.  I bought this one specifically because of how the nose area looked.  Disappointed
"I love blinders with speakers and this pair has the best design I have owned but it don't block called when you turn on the do not disturb.  It actually comes over your speakers and tells you "" in coming call 756 689 2567"" and repeats it several times.. This is very annoying and defeats the purpose of sleep with them on,  especially when you work 12 hr nights.. I would recommend them if you don't mind being disturbed during sleep but if you don't I don't recommend them because it will let you know every telemarketer trying to call you.."
"Fits & wears poorly. When eyes are covered, speakers don't cover ears. Even adjusted as tight as possible, mask slips."
This is really soft and feels good on my face BUT I noticed after several wears that the black dye from the material used on the insider of the mask discolors my face!  My face looks darkened/dirty and when I use a wet cloth to wipe my face I see dark material on the cloth.
"Thanks to PTSD, insomnia, and tinnitus, I run binaural beats to get to sleep and, preferably, STAY asleep. I've tried nearly every sleep headphone out there and really thought I'd found my answer here. Very comfortable, great sound quality, actually got the sound positioned perfectly with ease, but ...I bought two pair of these so I would have a backup. Within five weeks of purchase BOTH pairs (each charged ALL DAY) began failing after about four hours of run time. I awaken to silence and my tinnitus. Swapping for the second pair results in complete failure, as it hops offline in minutes. These apparently need two full days of charge time to get one full night's sleep.Glad I also bought a cheap wired pair as a backup to my backup.If I wanted to troubleshoot headphones in the middle of the night, I would be paid overnight tech support.Very comfortable if you're just looking for a sleep mask, but I can get that for $5. Do I sound grumpy? Sorry, I got 5 hours of sleep last night , interrupted by trying to make these things work."
"Unfortunately, for me, this mask is very uncomfortable to the point of being unusable.1. When I position the strap so that the headphone elements are in line with my ears, the tension of the strap pulls the mask out of place and it inevitably slips off of my face and down to my neck.2. The headphone elements themselves are quite thick, making side sleeping quite uncomfortable. I've used other products that have much thinner headphone elements."
"At first the charger was temperamental, I had to set it in a particular position. Now it won't charge at all. I've tried other chargers and at this point the item is going in the trash. I will have to search for another type or try a replacement. This blocks out others snoring in the room which I need as a light sleeper."
"First night of use, the audio faded out on me several times.  The power would remain on the headphones, but no audio.  This was not a volume control issue.  Headphones had to be shut off and rebooted to reconnect.  Just trying to reconnect Bluetooth did not fix it.  My received replacement showed signs of having been used.  Sending back both pairs tomorrow.  The the only reason I'm not giving it a 1 is because the mask itself was very comfortable and I liked the rubberized button panel."
"I received the package in good condition. Easy to attach to my phone. I have used it for about 3 nights now, and it's ok.  It has good sound and eye coverage. The mask it hot though. I wake up with the mask being damp in the middle of the night. The battery doesn't last for 8 or even 6 hours.Update: I have been using this mask still, the sound and controls are good. It still doesn't hold a long battery life.  The eye mask itself is comfortable, but during summer it was to warm to wear long periods of time. I have worn it more now during winter."
Broke within  a few months of usage. Won't charge.
"The mask itself is comfortable and blocks out light really well and the sound quality is pretty good. The actual speakers, are unfortunately, very thick and make it difficult (if not impossible) to sleep on your side. You basically have a thick disk pressing into your ear or temples. I get away with pulling one speaker out of the mask and just letting it dangle. The side padding is nice for a few weeks, but it does break down fast. They also don't cancel background noise because, again, it's just a flat disk under some light fabric.Side note: I actually bought this twice because I lost the first one and I noticed that the logo was different and the design is a little different too. This latest one could not control the volume at all or pause anything. They're probably sending items from other manufacturers that didn't sell and look similar, so yours may be better or worse than mine."
I ended up using the mask without the headphones because I don't like having a transmitter working on my forehead all night.
"When it worked it was perfect! has a very short battery life, and even that portion quit charging and stopped working after 2 months of nightly use (and yes, I was very careful to be gentle with it and never get it wet, etc.) It's just cheap, poor quality"
Last set I had would advance to the next song on Pandors. Looks like I can only manage volume and pause with this set.
"I actually really love this product and the concept of it. Whenever I have things rub on my ears, such as glasses, I get really bad headaches that turn into migraines. I bought this hoping that it wouldn't do it but it did. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 though, only because it is not noice canceling at all. My husband goes to sleep with the TV on (not very loud at all) and the side I wasn't laying on I could hear the TV clearly and not the music. At first I thought the left side speaker wasn't even working because I couldn't hear it. Anyways, super soft and comfortable minus it giving me headaches but that is something personal."
Works ok. The sound quality isn't bad. My only complaint is if you sleep on your ears (side or stomach sleeping) it starts to dig. The mask also slides around if you're an active sleeper and Toss and turn.
"My first one arrived defective and wouldn't charge.  Finally the tiny wires connecting the various components did snap; my usb connector is just GONE all of the sudden so no more charging.  5 month lifespan.I'd rather pay $5 for better construction than add to the global trash pile and replace it 1-3 times per year.  It's a shame because it is quite comfortable and good for light-blocking, with adequate sound and good battery life.  I may put it on the Christmas list, but I can't just buy another one right off the bat."
"I bought these for my husband at the end of 2021 and the bluetooth stopped working over a month ago.  He can no longer use these for music, only an eye mask.  The mask was okay when it was working, however I agree with others who have mentioned colored dye - every time he wears this mask, there is black dye all over the pillow case in the morning.  Never had this issue with other sleep headphones.  Going to see if we can replace them as this should still be under warranty."
"I bought these headphones to replace a well-liked Watotgafer (apparently no longer available?) that had given up and stopped making sound. There are other similar products but I was drawn to these because they don't have a power light indicator, something my partner found annoying about the previous headphones. The other big pro to these is the material, it's thicker and a bit more cushioned than I expected. I'm a side sleeper so sometimes the old one could be a bit uncomfortable, and this isn't a perfect fix or anything but it is an improvement. It blocks light effectively, and it seems to have more space in front of my eyes.As for the cons, it's a lot of little things. The buttons on the front are harder to press than the Watotgafer, and the only one that matters is the power/pause button. On the Watotgafer, the other buttons were for skipping forward or backwards in my media. In this, it's volume control, which is not a helpful feature when I'm using a sleep mask--i adjust volume from my phone and then put it away. The power on/off voice appears to be affected by the volume as well, and the default on level is also quite loud.The volume control is also weird in some other ways. Unlike every other Bluetooth device I have, it resets the volume every time I turn it on. And if I put the volume all the way to zero as a starting point, it makes a rather loud beep. Not a sound I want to hear when I'm trying to set my sleep podcast to a nice low volume.I don't totally regret the purchase, I do find it more comfortable, but the little things are annoying and sleep time is not a great time to be annoyed. In retrospect I could have met my partner's main request by buying any other sleep phones and putting a little tape over the light."
"I work nights and use this to block out light and help me fall asleep. Overall, I love it. I'm especially impressed with the long life after charging. I regularly fall asleep with an audio book playing and will wake up 7 hours later to the mask still playing, and then use it for another night without charging. Audio quality is good.It's not as great for blocking out light or sound. Getting it fixed on your face in such a way that the speakers are over your ears but the mask doesn't let in light can be tricky. It can also be awkward to get comfortable in if you want to lie on your side, because the speakers dig into your ear. Nothing that's stopped me from using it happily. It might be better for blocking out sound if you play white noise instead of an audio book.EDIT: Updating 6 months later. 2 things: 1) The elastic has become extremely stretched. I've had to continually adjust it tighter and it's now at the point where I can't tighten it much more. This is annoying, since the fit has never been perfect in the first place. You need to keep it snug in order to use it properly as a sleep mask and to hear the speakers, which naturally stretches the elastic, so it's kind of designed for failure in that respect.2) Audio quality has gone down a lot. I can't compare with the original sound without ordering a new pair, but it's definitely worse. I can't hear the audio unless I have the speaker part pressed against my ear, which has led to some weird sleep positions and messed with my neck.I reduced my rating to 3 stars to reflect these 2 things. Charging power has remained excellent, it will play all night if you let it. However it just doesn't work for its intended use, to play audio and block light, and the quality has degraded a lot. I would expect better for the price."
"Battery would not take a charge over 10% after first use. I charged it for an hour, 10%. I charged it for 2 hours, 10%. I charged it 4 hours, 10%."
"This probably would be great for normal sized heads, but it didn't work for me. The speakers set behind my ears and the elastic adjustment in the back just brings the speakers further away from the ears. Would be nice if someone made one in a smaller size."
"I tried it out and the comfort is good, sound quality could be better its not really clear. The speakers are complicated to move to where i want them."
"While it does have good sound, it is frustrating that everything easily moves out of place constantly. The wires have no pouch or secure location so they move everywhere, sometimes causing lumps you can feel over eyelids or making it difficult to find the charging port without a struggle. The power box also has nothing actually holding it in place so sometimes ill try to turn it on or off and I have to feel around and move the box back into place. So, while the removable features are a major plus that allows the mask to be cleaned properly, there needs to be an effective way to keep things where they belongI tried giving it one more night but the fact that I try to lay down and the stupid charging cord moved to right over my eye, then down my cheek, then the power box moved. I'm returning it. Don't waste your money, find something better"
"Really comfortable mask. Best I've found for comfort. But micro-usb charging cord? Hello, 2007 calling.Also the built in sounds, as for the rain sound, it's on a loop and pauses silently for a second between loops which would forever keep me awake, so couldn't use that and had to go with Bluetooth which I'd prefer not to have to sync up every night. Fix the sounds and update the USB port to usb-c and it'd be the best mask out there.After returning this, I finally decided to re-order it and swap out the electronics to suit me better."
"I've been through a few different brands of these type of headphones. These ones last longer than the others, but still only last about 6-7 months. They are comfortable, keep out the light and sound quality is good. But you will have to purchase new ones when they no longer keep a charge."
I've had 3 of these. Loved my first one so much that I bought another just for travel. Then the dog got ahold of my first and I had to replace it. The battery I this holds a charge for less than half of the time as my others. Very disappointing and annoying to have to connect it to the charger almost every night. My first one could go a week to 10 days.
Liked it a lot until I woke up with ear pain.  Fine for back sleeping buy I don't recommend for side sleepers
For its price it worth it best sleep with terrible roommates
Gives acne if not cleaned every other day. It doesn't get as tight as I'd like but all in all is a good product
Better than expected. Comfortable and good sound
This is the best product I have ever purchased from Amazon! My sleep quality has improved greatly.
"Relaxing, love to sleep in this mask listening to my favorite music 🎶"
Feel like these are a good upgrade to the ones I wore out.
I love using these to listen to books on tape or a soothing soundscape while I go to sleep. They are soft comfortable and when my new puppy chewed my last sleep mask I didn't hesitate to buy another one from the same supplier.
Like how I can listen to music at night
"I have several pairs of music streaming facemasks. They don't last quite as long as I'd like them to, so based on the price I end up just buying new ones. I haven't tried this brand before, but I love them. They have cut outs? For your eyes and aren't tight against them. I just had eye surgery and was worried the regular ones would rub them too hard. I really like these a lot!"
Increíble
Helps me sleep in the same room with a loud snorer.Doesn't have any noise-cancellation but it looks like its the best one on the market.
"I work the 2ed shift at a truck shop and I have a hard time falling asleep, these are nice to put on when I'm ready to go to bed and pass out. The only thing I wish to have changed is that the low battery notification is a little loud, if that could be turned down I would be much happier with this product."
I have had 3 different sleep masks.  This one is the most comfortable and has a great battery life.  I can sleep with white noise on all night with no problem.  That is a big advantage over the other masks I have owned.None of these masks is that comfortable for a side-sleeper though.  The speakers will push into your ear growing pretty uncomfortable after a while.  I push the speaker up off my ear for the down-side ear.Very good set up overall though - I recommend this product.
"I normally go to bed before my wife, and using this mask allows me to leave a light on for her. The Bluetooth headphones allow me to listen to an audiobook as I'm falling asleep. The mask is comfortable and very good at blocking out the light, and the speakers work well. This is a very good bargain for the price."
"Amazingly, this item has better Bluetooth range than many of our household's earbuds and headphones; the sound is very clear; the extra ""flaps"" around the nose keep it nice and dark and the wells make it comfortable; it's a simple product with no frills so it is very easy to use. The only reason it didn't get five stars is this is my second time buying this product because it doesn't seem to last long --granting I use it daily without fail but I never travel with it, never use it for anything other than night-time sleep and I treat it gently. I'm concerned about the environment and if I have to repurchase this item again in less than a year I'll have to find a longer lasting alternative."
"The sleeping mask is very comfortable and soft. I was afraid that the velcro strap would be uncomfortable, but it is very comfortable. It is difficult to get the speakers in the right spot for my ears. The mask will be in the right spot for my eyes, but the part of the strap where the speakers are located is too high for my ears. When I do get the speakers aligned with my ears the volume is very good. There is no noise cancellation. I do not use the volume controls on the mask, instead I use the controls on my phone."
"I didn't buy this for noise cancellation, I bought it to cover the sounds and flickering lights from the TV. I still wanted to hear other sounds, ex. movement in my room, dog wanting to go outside or child calling for me. This product does exactly what I need. The speakers do move around the mask while sleeping. I made a slight modification to the mask and now the speakers are perfect. The speakers don't bother my ears or head. I'm surprised how comfortable it is when I sleep on my side. I also find that I don't wear it all night, I must unconsciously take it off while sleeping. The sound quality is surprisingly really good. The straps with Velcro don't allow me to secure the mask snuggly to my head. It feels too big when on. If the Velcro was positioned differently I would be able to adjust the mask tighter to my head. To resolve this issue, I carefully sewed the straps so that they are smaller. It fits perfectly now. I have to say I'm very impressed with this product. It works exactly as I had hoped it would."
"I've tried everything for my ptsd nightmares with no success.  These are great for blocking light and I've been listening to ""pink noise"" and it's helped.  The left side isn't very comfortable because of the wires. Otherwise, I'd give 5 stars"
"This review is really only about the eye mask, not the earphones. I can't listen to ""white noise"" to cancel sound but wanted a mask that covers the ears to help hold in foam earplugs to actually block the noise. In this aspect, it works well but I would prefer the part covering the ears to be a little bigger. I've removed the electronics entirely and haven't tried them so can't speak to that. The mask itself is comfortable with plenty of room for the eyes, I can actually open my eyes and not even feel the mask over them. It's a little tight on the bridge of the nose though. The Velcro band is the only real point of failure. There is a 2-3 inch strip of Velcro to adjust the fit, but to fit to my head, there is only about 1/4 inch of contact, and I don't think I have that small of a head. I've had to take a couple of small safety pins to either side of the Velcro to help hold the straps, small easy fix. I would have liked to have found a basic mask that covered both eyes and ears without having to pay for the electronics but it still seems worth it."
"I wanted headphones to use in bed and probably fall asleep in.  I found out pretty quick I didn't like using this as a mask.  However, I was able to use it more like a headband and it works well.  I can listen to my audio books or music just fine.  And, if I fall asleep wearing it I am not uncomfortable."
Helping my daughter sleep must better.
"This mask works great to keep light out of my eyes while sleeping. When I wake up several hours later, it has only moved a tiny bit and just needs to be bumped to achieve close to 100% light blocked.The shape/design of where the speakers are is a bit odd so that if you are using the speakers to fall asleep the band behind your head needs to be significantly lower than where it feels like it ""should"" be to line up the speakers with your ears.It doesn't shut itself off automatically after a period of silence, like the other Bluetooth speakers I use at night, so when I wake up it is still ""on"" which may be a plus for some people, but I feel like it wastes the battery, since I set a sleep timer on whatever I am listening to."
It works great. It blocked out all the light and it didn't bother me in anyway I slept
"I liked the fact that it adjusts,  the volume can be controlled easily But turn it on BEFORE you put it on as that is LOUD.  It is not as comfortable lying on you side as on your back, but is ok.  I think it will be great in a plane."
I found it easy to set up and pair.  I haven't used it with phone calls yet.  I think it is difficult to find and adjust the volumn when you have it on.  It doesn't fit me particularly well as I have gaps under my eyes because I have to strap it low on the back of my head for the audio to fit over my ears.  It tends to make me hot after a while.  It is great for listening to books or music while falling to sleep and not disturbing your partner.
I kept falling asleep with my airpods in so I thought I'd give this a try. It's SO good for sleeping. It's super comfortable and blocks alllll the light! First few days I woke up disoriented not realizing it was even morning lol! Speakers are great but I wouldn't call it noise canceling. Though that's not my intended use so I don't mind
"These work well and were easy to connect to my phone. I'm a side sleeper. The eye part is very comfortable, but the speakers hurt my ears no matter where I put them. They stayed on all night, but after a few nights I ended up having to take them off halfway through due to the pain. To be fair, I ended up buying a different (and much more expensive) brand, and they also hurt my ears, but not as bad as these."
"I bought this to replace the sleep earbuds I have, which are wired. Those are incredibly comfortable and create a faux-noise cancelling seal. This headband is rather comfortable once properly positioned and tightened. It feels great against the face and I have not experienced any major discomfort sleeping on my side. That said, the mask leaves a dye on my face after every morning so far. I don't know if it's because I chose the deep blue variety but be aware of that.I love the playtime duration you can get out of this mask for the time spent charging it, I connects seamlessly to my computer and feels pretty comfortable. It helps me get to sleep faster, which is the point. 3.75/5 stars (maybe a 4, but the dye issue so far knocks the score down a bit)."
"So I got this to replace a different brand that broke after a few years of use. I love the fit, and the way it doesn't press on the eyes are perfect. This outdoes my old pair. The sound is a little muffled, but still quite usable. I just wish it didn't scream ""power on"" ""connected"" like all these Bluetooth things seem to do. Haven't had it go down enough in power yet, but If this yells at full volume ""Low Power"" or some sorta sound, I will be upset. Other than that, so far so good!"
"It is comfortable over my eyes and ears, though the little speakers inside the visor needed some adjusting so so they'd be right over my ears.  It holds a charge all night. The speakers don't seem to ""leak"" sound so it doesn't bother my other half as he sleeps (he is also a light sleeper). The headphones aren't noise-canceling, which I thought might be an issue for me, but I played meditation music which helped me ""zone out"" so outside noise doesn't bother me. I really like that the eye coverings are recessed; I can still open my eyes, but I literally can't see anything and this really fools my brain into thinking it's pitch black outside. In all, this sleep visor is extremely effective, and if you're having trouble falling asleep (isn't everyone in 2021?) and STAYING asleep, this may really do the trick. I didn't even need melatonin! The only thing is the on/off/volume control doesn't seem to be anchored in the visor (in fact, I pulled it all the way out) so the blue light indicator doesn't always show through the holes... I couldn't tell if it was off or on. But other than that... I""m extremely happy with this, especially since it's reasonably priced."
"The unit failed in 1 1/2 years. The charging connecter broke. The design of the wire is is not okay. We all know that the wire has to be pulled out from the pocket once every two days to charge. Abetter deign is have permanent charge port, so that it lasts longer time. I am disappointed with the product. The sound is great, I used it everyday for my Tinnitus. Wish I can buy it again, but will not"
"Ok, so I was super excited to get this mask because my fiancé snores like nobodies business and I thought some lovely white noise would be perfect to drown it out. It didn't. The ""ear pieces"" move around so you have to reposition them every time you move your head on your pillow. There is no volume control only skip options and they are definitely not aligned with the stitched on the figures. And the absolute kicker is that I started noticing blackheads on my forehead! Today I woke up and it looked like I had been beaten. I used some makeup remover and the pad came away purple, the thing is bleeding into my skin! I'm sorry but this product is just so poorly made I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"This is my second sleep headphone that I have tried and this one was disappointing.Pros:Adjustable strapSpeakers line up to your earsCons:Very uncomfortable. The material is very heavy and presses against my noise making breathing awkward. It is not as cooling as suggested.My husband is a snorer and even at the loudest volume I can hear him very clearly. This was the main reason I need these so I'm disappointed these didn't help with thatOverall, in a pinch they may be helpful but I would not recommend"
"I tested out a few of these and because I work at night I needed something that would block out the noice of the outside while trying to sleep, these are very loud but definitely not ideal for blocking out noise at all. The velcro strap used to secure it on the back of your head was not quite thought out at all, it seems to be designed for someone with a much larger head, so it constantly slipped off while trying to sleep with the front of the mask not really blocking out the light because of this. But great idea! After a few weeks of constant frustration feeling with this mask I ended up going back to my normal silk mask with my noise cancelling huge headphones."
"Noise cancellation is non-existent but that's not what I bought it for.The speakers, charger, and controls float around the headphones and I'm constantly having to adjust them.It was still worth it until they completely stopped pairing. The Bluetooth must have quit. I've reset everything and they just don't work anymore.Bottom line, not worth it."
"The mask was WAY too big when I got it. Not sizeable almost at all. Then kept waking up with black powdery residue on my face. Finally wiped my bedsheet across the inside of the sleep mask one night as a test, and black residue indeed came off and smudged my sheets. This was after I washed the product upon receiving. Very unhappy and sad to return because I love the sound quality and it has never run out of battery on me. But way to big and the residue is gross."
The indicator light for the controls was hard to see.  Not comfortable laying on speakers.  Was warm too wear.  I had to return.
"I got this and it was actually pretty decent for the first couple of days (about 4-5). But after that, charging them wasn't working. It wouldn't charge over 10%. At first I thought it would be ok since that's like maybe 15 to 30 minutes max and I could fall asleep by then. But every minute the device tells me loudly that battery is low."
"While the eye mask blocks out light effectively and is comfortable on the face, the speakers are made of hard plastic inside the headband which can make sleeping on your side painful to the ear area.  Additionally,  when the content you played to fall asleep ends, the headset announces ""BLUETOOTH DISCONNECTING"" and ""POWER OFF"" which can wake you up if you are not deeply asleep."
Covers the eyes and blocks out light well. The little speakers don't stay in place and the dye on the black ones comes off on your skin.
"This product is great for its sound quality, noise cancelling, long battery life (lasted several days before the need to recharge), but upon recharging it did not take the charge.  It has now been 3 days and it is still saying ""low battery"" after having been charging for hours.  There is clearly a battery issue.  Very disappointed as I have only had the product for just over a month."
"Worked great! Until it didn't. I loved this eye mask  and headphone set, until it stopped working.It really blocks out light, and I loved listening to my sleep stories before it stopped working.Now I turn it on and it turns itself off, it says it's pairing and then it stops. I'm just very frustrated and can't make it work and it's too late to return it for replacement."
"Pros - Soft fabric. Great at blocking light. Good sound. Earbuds can move in pockets so you fit it to your face/head size. Came with travel bag. Super comfortable as a face mask. Blocks out MOST of my husband's snoring.Cons - Velcro gets caught in long hair!! 😭😭😭 (I have a little head so there is more available to get caught. Ear buds can move in pockets so that some moderate shifting affects hearing. Does not come with USB to Wall block. Only blocks out MOST my husband's snoring, and at certain volumes my husband can hear my music. Not comfortable as a headband. You feel like an idiot boopin' buttons on your forehead. 🤣😂"
"I purchased this item and had to return it a few weeks later because the speakers stopped working.  I really liked the way it fit my head so I bought it again.  After 2 months of use the speakers crapped out again.  I was not hoping for the best sound quality as I was using it to fall asleep at night, however the sound quality was good for about 2 weeks then started to decline very rapidly.Charging cable is awkward to get out and put back in. Speakers are poor quality.  The only reason I gave this item 2 stars is because I liked the way the mask fit on my face.  very dissapointed!"
"I was really excited to receive these, as I'd been wanting them for a while. However, my excitement lasted all of a day. The material stained the skin it came into contact with black even after washing (and the material showed wear after a single wash)!  And the sound quality changed once I removed the mechanical parts to wash it. It went from great sound to a tinny quality. Very distracting when you're trying to listen to audiobooks. :/ Volume control on the mask itself is non-existent, as the only buttons on it are play, forward, and rewind, so you have to control volume on your device/phone.They get the job done for blocking out the light, but I'm already on the lookout for a replacement. Very disappointed."
"Kind of uncomfortable. The noise parts hurt if they're right at your ear and are a side sleeper. The sound is great though. And unlike regular eye masks that you can tuck behind your ear, you can't do that with these. Unless you want the mask to not sit right. They slide up and down my face since I'm a tosser. And if I make it too tight, it hurts my ears."
"Very comfortable. Nose cut-out means you can breath through your nose - much better than other models. But - the electronics are poor. When initially pairing, it takes a long time before you see the mask show up as a Bluetooth option in your device (at least for two iPhones I paired it with.) Much longer than other Bluetooth masks I've tried. Once paired, the play/stop button and volume buttons all have very long lag times. It's difficult to control changing the volume and not accidentally change the track. Pressing the volume buttons (short or long) usually doesn't work and I need to reach for my phone and control the volume there. If you can deal with substandard controls, the mask itself is comfortable, blocks light well, and had good enough speaker quality given that the speakers just lay close to your ears rather than being in them like buds or firmly on as with standard headphones. Really wish the electronics worked better. Maybe I just got a bad one."
"I bought these because I was tired of wired sleep phones and the advertised 10 hour battery life seemed great.  I have yet to get more than 2-hours of play time from them.  The battery runs down super fast.  This is not helpful for me as I use these because I wake up several times a night and use the audio to help me fall back to sleep.  For the time they are playing they are great, they fit well and have great sound."
It stopped charging after 6 months. I only started using it daily about 3 months ago…very disappointed. They were great until then!
"This is probably the most comfortable sleep mask that I've ever owned, but the speakers won't stay put, so they are frequently near the corner of my eyes, which means I can't hear the audio playing. Even with the volume turned as high as it will go, I have significant difficulty making out whatever I am listening to."
This blindfold fits so comfortably and your eyes don't feel like they are suffocating!!! Best purchase ever! I love the speakers too !! Nice touch for when you want to listen to calming music while drifting off and you aren't worried about disturbing others!
"love these, i don't have curtains yet and this blocks out the annoying sun in the mornings. incredible battery life, although i wish the sound was a bit louder"
"ive only used this twice but wow !! game changer wish id had this a long time ago i have alot of issues shutting by brain off to fall asleep , racing thoughts i love this item !"
Absolutely love them comfortable can hear the music really well. Recommend 10 out of 10.
"Fantastic for the price. It's not exactly the pinnacle of wireless audio technology, but it's cheap, it works fine for white noise, soft music, sleep ASMR, and the battery lasts all night.Update, forgot to charge it, battery lasts two nights."
"This is just about perfect! 5 stars without question. Been using for about a year every night and they still work as they did on day one. Volume is very easy to use while wearing and the battery last all night +. The only ""problem"" I have with them is actually part of its benefit, since the comfortable speakers are adjustable in the headband for a perfect fit over your ears, they do tend to move when not wearing so they do need to be readjusted when you put them back on. The volume is great and very clear and crisp. This is a definite buy if you need a sleep mask and Bluetooth headphones."
"I bought this because my boyfriend snores and I am a super light sleeper. The speakers on these can drown out almost anything even if they aren't at full volume. The padding around the eyes is nice and really blocks out every ounce of light. I could sleep with the lights or tv on and would never know it. The battery life is insane. I can use this for two nights in a row for 8-12 hours each night before having to charge it which is just crazy to me. The speakers are decently comfortable to sleep on if you are a side sleeper. They don't bother me too much but if I stay in the same spot the whole night my ear might be a little sore. Everything is really adjustable though, so you can move where the speakers sit on your ear which is great!"
"I honestly don't use the bluetooth much but I know it works. Pretty comfortable, I work nights so these are a lifesaver to sleep in the day."
"This mask blocks out the light and the little Bluetooth speakers sound great. Works well for side sleeping. As someone who keeps strange hours and often sleeps in the daytime, my husband loves this sleep mask."
"Just get it, you will have zero regrets!! My husband and I have SUCH peaceful sleep now that I have these. I'm a side sleeper and have no issues with the headphones because you can adjust so much both for band fit and internal speaker and button placement. 11/10 recommend for comfort, light blocking, and needing sound to fall asleep."
I love this product but the battery stopped being able to charge at around the 6 month mark.
I love everything about these headphones except the speakers are fully and cause ears to hurt for a side sleeper. Needs to have flatter speakers.
"Easy to use, fits nice, helps get some white noise with out big ear buds."
"I found as I've gotten older it's harder for me to fall or sleep and stay asleep. My bedroom has a lot of windows so the light and noise wakes me up pretty easily. My wife started using a sleep mask. Initially I made fun of her. But then I realized it was the perfect solution for blocking out the sun light.So I purchased a regular sleep mask which came with some foam ear plugs. The mask worked great for blocking out the sunlight. The foam ear piece worked okay but it was uncomfortable. And honestly I would prefer to have certain sounds playing like white noise or the ocean sounds.I was on instagram and came across a mask that also included built in bluetooth earphones. So i figured let me check amazon and sure enough they had this eye mask ear bluetooth combo. I decided to purchase it. The short of it, is it's been amazing and highly recommended for anyone that wants to be able to block out light and sound.PROS- Blocks out light without pressing on your eyeballs.- The speakers positions can be easily adjusted so they don't hurt your head or ears.- The mask is very soft and has enough padding to feel comfortable with you're a side sleeper or not.- The velcro strap is adjustable for different head sizes.- The speakers can get pretty loud and block out the outside sound.CONS- I would have preferred a non velcro strap that is adjustable. I just feel over time the velcro may lose its stickiness.- The sound quality is decent. It's not as good as my airpod pros. But it's good enough for sleeping.- You can adjust the volume to be louder and adjust the speakers to be closer to your ears to cancel out most noise. But this isn't a true noise cancelling device.- I wish the control buttons were better designed so it's easier to differentiate each button while the mask is on.My biggest concern is the velcro strap. Hopefully they will design a different strap going forward. But this mask is cheap enough where if I had to buy another one, I wouldn't mind."
"Love them, but I wish they were a bit better at cancelling noise, or louder. Extremely comfortable and excellent at blocking all light!"
It has a great battery life of over 16 hours audio is perfect the only things that I could complain about are very minor it doesn't block out a small bit of light and the speakers move out of place fairly easily but it's super easy to move back into place so if I could I would honestly rate it 4.5 stars because as I said the flaws are very minor
the cords move the power piece around. but it is comfy soft and good Bluetooth sound. my hubby likes it and it is washable
I don't like this it's not very loud the mask falls off my face so easily I'm having to move it up to keep it on my face
"Connecting the mask to my phone via Bluetooth was easy, and the mask itself worked as I hoped it would (comfortable, decent audio quality, kept out light). My only complaint is that you can't set it to shut off by itself, so the battery just runs out by the morning and you need to recharge it for the next use. But for the price it's fine."
"This is a comfortable mask that is good at blocking light, but the controls in the middle of the mail slide around really easily, and so it's difficult to figure out which button is which when it goes all topsy-turvy on you."
"I got this because my spouse likes to have the tv on all night (ugh). I thought this would help and I could listen to rain sounds to drown out the sports channel. When you first lie down they are great, but the speakers move around too much through the night and start hurting my ears because they shift up too high or move to far back etc. also the Bluetooth receiver is not comfortable on the forehead and you will wake with an indentation"
"The long and the short is that the headphones protrude too much for my liking personally. I sleep on my side and while it was okay for about an hour or so, it does get incredibly uncomfortable no more than 90 minutes into the wearing experience. The battery also dies way too fast. My Sony Bluetooth earbuds have nearly triple the battery (7 hours vs roughly 130 minutes) and they take way too long to charge.If you sleep on your back or stomach and are only occasionally on your side, these may work for you, same if are only looking to drift to off to sleep and not have them on all night. Also the noise suppression isn't great. The headphones are serviceable for sleep-style music but if you have a fan not on it's lowest setting, it does become noticeable nearly immediately."
"I usually have a hard time falling asleep. And often found that listening to an audio book I've already listened to while trying to fall asleep helps. However, I wake up in the middle of the night with my ears hurting from sleeping on my normal ear buds.That's what got me to purchase this mask. I didn't expect it to help me sleep faster by covering my eyes too!  Blocking out light from my room actually helped a great deal.  It fits comfortably and when positioning the speakers in the mask the right way I can fall asleep on my sides without hurting me. The sound quality is just right for my needs. It really helped me a lot with falling asleep faster and sleeping through the night. I highly recommend this product if you are having similar issues i mentioned I had before.I will say that my only disappointment is that the part that goes over the nose on one side isn't fully keeping the light out due to the padding not being even. So there is light coming through between my nose and right cheek that unfortunately is the side next to the window."
"Plays music, definitely not sound proof. I can still hear everything around me like snoring. Does not cancel out noise. Will continue to try to use it"
"My old black mask lasted me 2 years.  It broke the wiring from the speaker.  I love sleeping in this mask.  It helped me sleep.  Now I decided to buy a new one instead of the broken one.  And I figured out that such masks of other colors appeared.  I liked pink.  When I received my new pink mask, I smelled a chemical smell.  I decided to wash it so that the smell would go away, but it remains.  The company that makes these masks should pay attention to the environmental friendliness of the materials it uses.  I like everything about the new mask, except for the smell, which cannot be removed."
"The audio is good but the size of the headband is made for a large head, it would be helpful to have more strap adjustments."
"There's a voice that tells you when she's connected to Bluetooth and on/off and then while you are sleeping she YELLS ""low battery""! Why is it so loud? This is a sleep mask. Not a wake up mask!! Otherwise comfortable and works well."
"I think this is good product. Soft material, ear pieces are hidden and non-evasive. Eye pockets are deep and soft, good fit I think.Product simply did not fit my head, my heads problem I believe. No matter how tight I made it it just slips downward towards neck. To bad for me.Never had a chance to try the mask as it simply didn't fit me."
"There are several things I find annoying about the operation of this product.1) The light indicators on my mask have never worked. Since the first day, I have not seen any light. This makes it more difficult to understand charge status, etc.2) I have a pretty average-sized head and this mask is far too big. I think I will have to sew it so that it will fit.3) I really wish the central button could be used as a pause/play button.4) There is no confirmation when the unit is turned off. Usually I have to push the button for about 5s, but sometimes it stays on and then my calls and sounds are all roited to the mask after I've woken up.5) I really wish that the unit would turn off after not getting any sounds for a certain period of time. I usually listen to a 30-60m video as I fall asleep. During the night, my mask often come off (especially since it is so large). When my alarm goes off in the morning, sometimes I don't hear it because it is ringing on the mask, which is no longer on my head. This is a huge issue for me. I bought this mask to help me sleep well - instead I have a restless sleep while stressing out thay I may oversleep!"
It worked great for about a month. Now it randomly shuts down even when fully charged.  Cannot use it at all.  Very disappointing since its super soft but worthless if it doesnt work.
I've charged this thing maybe 3 times since I got it. The battery lasts so long. I'm a flight attendant and on long flights we get a nap period but the lights in the cubby don't always turn off so this is so perfect to maximize my rest!
as if I have no worries in my mind. I wish the volume could be a bit louder to muffled my dogs completely when they hear something outside but considering everything they are great with noise cancellation.
"I was on the verge of smothering him just to get some peace and quiet, but pretty sure I am not suited for jail…. Thank you sweet baby Jesus for this sleep mask that saved my marriage and a trip to the pokey."
"Easy to use, comfortable, and adjustable (the size and the earphones). I love that it is washable. It charges well, and lasts more than one night. I purchased this because I was rooming in a hotel with a colleague, and it worked better than expected! Worth every penny. Hope it lasts, but I think it will...."
"I use this as a sleep mask.  I have been using it for about a month and am very pleased.I have often left the TV on when sleeping but used a sleep mask so that the flashing of the screen didn't bother me, so I am used to a sleep mask.  The TV acts as background or ""white"" noise so I don't hear other sounds in the house.  I feel I sleep better.Last year I added a blue tooth adapter to the TV so I could watch sports and such with headphones without disturbing my wife who dislikes sports.  That works great.  So I wanted to try a blue tooth sleep mask.I have to say that I am quite pleased with the Sleep Headphones.  They are quite comfortable with a nice space for the eyes.  They immediately bonded to my TV Bluetooth adapter.I normally put them on the charger when I get up.  Recently I forgot to charge them and expected they would quit during the night, but they didn't.  So I have gotten at least 15 hours on a charge and could likely have gone longer.I have not done any testing with music or other sounds to judge quality but they are more than adequate for my purposes.  They really don't work as headphones for watching TV or other waking uses.  But as sleep headphones, they work great.  I would recommend them to a friend.This is the TV bluetooth adapter I am using.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XHGS32J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Note that this one has a bit of a lag when watching TV programs with my regular headset.  Lips can get slightly out of sync with the words. There are higher-level ones that avoid this but you need a headset that has a feature that cuts the lag.  I bought this one because it was inexpensive as a trial unit to see if I liked a headset set-up for my TV so that I don't disturb others when I am watching TV.  It is adequate for my needs.If you want a bluetooth sleep headset, I think you will like this one."
"I got this so I wouldn't hear my husband snore. I wasn't sleeping. This is great at getting light out of eyes and blocking noise. It isn't 100% noise canceling, but it does the job."
The extra cushion around the eyes makes for a very comfortable sleep. This mask completely blocks out all light. Add music via Bluetooth and you've got a great tool to help you sleep through just about anything.
"My husband loves this product. It fits comfortably on his head, while blocking out all the light in the room. The quality of the music, which is via bluetooth from his cell phone is loud enough in his ears, but I don't hear a thing and my head is only 8 inches away. I give this 5 *****"
Fits to face perfect and presses on your pressure points nicely paired with a nice ASMR video and you're in heaven fast
I really can't even see a little bit of light through or around these.Furthermore the speakers are adjustable!  How am I supposed to hear other people snoring when these can be adjusted to line up with my ear holes.
"I got this sleep mask so I wouldn't have to put my phone under my pillow so that I could listen to music as I fell asleep. (I share a college dorm with two roommates so I don't want to bother them or wake them up.) The sleep mask is super soft and cozy- it's by far one of the nicest sleep masks I've had. The sound quality is also really nice and the music sounds clear. My biggest complaint is the back strap. The strap securing the sleep mask is made of velcrow, and I can only secure it to a certain point. If I were to sit up straight in bed with the mask on, it'd fall off my face easily. I like to keep the sleep mask fairly tight on my face, and this didn't feel as secure as I'd have liked. But aside from that, it's definitely a worthwhile purchase for me!"
"I recently took an international trip, so intended to use this on the airplane as well as in hotels.  The blackout quality of the mask was excellent; however, the speakers didn't fit over my ear as well as I had hoped.  I had to really tighten them using the Velcro straps to get them to stay over my ears.  Given that, I still think they are well worth the money I spent and would recommend them and will definitely use them in the future."
"I use this mask every night to sleep for the better part of this year (2023). This is probably the best mask I have tried. However after many months of use, I am noticing that the seam is starting to rub against my right ear making it sore.Volume controls are easy to use with or without the mask on. Very soft against the skin. Nice cupping in eye area. Headband portion could be designed a bit better. I have a smaller head and sometimes the excess Velcro gets stuck in my hair.Other than the minor issues, great product and would definitely recommend"
"The material feels nice and the sound quality is good. There is no volume control, the -/+ buttons are for previous/next song. There is no noise cancelling, or if there is it's very minimal. I could hear someone next to me clear as day with the volume on my phone at 70%. The strap sits very low on the back of my head, I agree with other reviews that it feels like it will slide off my face after awhile.I'll try it for awhile and see how it goes."
"These sleep headphones are super comfy and soft, easy to set up, easy to use, blocks out all light, sits comfortably on the bridge of the nose, and the speakers are adjustable inside their pouch which was a plus!!  Definitely a great value for the price also!! Plus you get an extra warranty from the company if any of the electronics components fail.  Great buy!!"
The headphones shift a lot and the audio is kinda too soft. Really wish there was a noise cancellation option.
"it's a nice sleep mask, the only thing is that it's a little more thin than I was expecting"
"I bought these about a year ago and have absolutely loved them! Great sound, comfortable, sleep with them almost every night. Only thing is the charging cord. Where it's tucked away into the left earphone part, I've come across having a short in it from where it gets misplaced over time while using these to sleep. Could be a shorter cord that wouldn't get so tangled and cause it to get a short and be unable to charge at times but otherwise, awesome product."
I like that the headphones adjust forwards and backwards.
"Fits comfortable and connects easily via Bluetooth. Does what it says, although not sure why there would be an expectation for noise cancelling in such a product. It has thin earphones embedded in the soft sides, which work well but definitely don't cancel any background noise. Happy with choice of these."
"Reasonably priced, works great, I've been buying sleep masks from this seller for ages. The wires can get tangled and after a year or so if you're not careful and making sure you're not awkwardly bending wires at the same angle for long periods of time, it will eventually short out, but the new versions are always an upgrade, so I don't mind!"
Just as described. Great fast service
These are so comfortable and help make it easy to relax with soothing sounds at any time of the day.
Works great! Speakers are don't hurt your ears and the mask is super comfortable and keeps all the light out.
"HONEST REVIEW: Please note that I was solicited for this! But it really wasn't an issue because I have gone through so many of these bluetooth sleeping masks and need everyone to know this is the BEST on Amazon. I AM THE BLUETOOTH SLEEPING MASK EXPERT!!!!! Just don't leave them lying around if you have a dog! I keep leaving them out and my dog destroys them! I gotta say though - I can't sleep without this mask. Once you start, you can never sleep without it. It truly does change the game. I have really bad ADHD and anxiety and an irrational fear of the dark, and this mask hugs my face so firmly but gently and it makes me feel super safe. I blast the Skyrim soundtrack in my ears every single night. My only complaint is that the voice when you turn on the mask is SUPER JARRING. Also, please always make sure the first thing you do when you get out of bed is put this on the charger. Because if you're sleeping and the battery dies, she screams ""POWER OFF!"". Like fully yells at you. Why are you yelling at me? So just keep it charged and you're all good (: But yeah - this one is hands down the most durable and fitting to my head. I have a massive head and it feels snug in the best way, but it would be fine on a small head as well. A lot of the other ones on here have meh quality and wear down eventully but these feel good."
"Can't complain for the price! Great Bluetooth sleep mask for falling asleep. Set my audiobook/podcast sleep timer for 30 min and the voice knocks me out without disturbing my wife!Pros:- Comfy eye relief sleep mask, adjustable strap- Long battery life (many nights)- Slim speakers, they go very quiet too- USB-C chargingCons:- Doesn't automatically turn off once the audio pauses. (will turn off after disconnected)- They don't block or 'cancel' noise at all, that shouldn't be listed as a feature.- Clicky buttons are a little loud at night- Wish the speakers could move even further to the sides- Wish there was another volume step between the lowest, and 2nd lowest. Not bad though.- ""LC-Dolida"" is a stupid random word brand name on a white label product.Overall, for $23, I'm satisfied. Comfy mask, good battery life, it is so nice to fall asleep to audio and have it block the light too!"
"SImple to use, very comfortable and the sound is really good"
"Because of the mixed reviews I was real hesitant in buying this, but I figured for $20 and change....why not. I am so glad I did. I am one of those people that needs music in the background to sleep. My guy? Music keeps him up. So for 11Yrs I have been miserable listening to only the fishtanks and room fans, and he and one of our dogs snoring.I have very sensitive ears, I cannot wear in ears (unless the comfy silicone), I cannot wear anything like the air pods, I can't even wear regular headphones. The cartilage of my ears are so sensitive, I have to watch what kind of pillow I use or I'll wake up in the middle of the night with SEVERE ear pain.This sleep mask has been a savior, once I got around the learning curve of connecting and it staying connected throughout the night. I had it connected to my phone, but the minute I got a notification, it disconnected. So now I use a music dedicated iPod. No connectivity issues at all. The sound is amazing. The speakers are so thin, no issues. You can move them around, so I keep mine placed on my temples. It doesn't diminish the quality of the sound at all. The longest I've had the mask running is 10 hours. But it was still playing when I woke. You DO need to charge them before use. I forgot one night, woke up to silence. Which is ok, because the mask itself is very comfortable, and keeps out the light.All in all, 5 stars.If you want full noise cancellation, keep the volume up a bit and speakers over your ears. I prefer to hear a little of what's going on because my guy and on of our elderly dogs have sleep apnea. So I keep my speakers over my temples, and volume a little lower. But not low enough where I can hear the 2 of them snoring. LOL"
"Easy use Bluetooth, the sleeping mask is good quality as well."
"La primera vez que lo use me fascinaron, tienen una textura muy suave e increiblemente son muy comodos para dormir, creo que me hace dormir mejor al mantenerme mas a oscuras y me da un soporte adicional en mi almohada. A veces lo uso con sonido pero la mayoria de las veces solo lo uso para dormir, son realmente comodos."
"I bought this product to see if it could help with staying asleep during the early hours of the night, specificallyduring working days.  I used to be a night shift worker and I wish I had bought this 9 yrs ago. Recently I started working days, and it has been an adjustment.Often my problem was the subtle noises such as dogs barking, kitchen or the shower sounds, as I would be easily woken up and hard to fall asleep or stay asleep. During the day we have to add the lawnmower or trimmers, along with busses and any other construction.  At night my partner likes to sleep with the TV on as a background noise.My partner had a change of schedule, which pushed their bedtime to 1 AM, and I have to be awake by 4:45 AM. Once them got home at 10:30 pm, I could hear the noises in the kitchen and then the shower (sits behind my breadboard).With this mask, it soft and fits comfortably in my face. I don't feel claustrophobic and after adjusting the location of the speakers, I can fall asleep and STAY asleep.My only problem is the daily adjusting of the speakers, but if I'm rubbing my head to the pillow, this explains the movement of the speakers.The battery does last about 3 nights, and I'm quite pleased with it.The quality of the speakers is good for the price point. Don't expect BOSE quality or JBL.Overall this was a good buy and has improved my sleep during work days."
"This is one of the best inventions ever! I can listen to my rain and thunderstorms or hypnosis and it blocks out the noise in the house. I live with my son and daughter-in-law and their two children 11 and 4. Sometimes our house gets a little noisy to say the waste. I can put these on wrap the pillow around my head and I don't hear anything. I use it at night also to fall asleep. Easy to use, the speakers for the ears are movable back to front to adjust to how you need them charging doesn't take long it is charged with the  C charger. Which is included in the package. I had two of these already by music cozy this seems to be the same company. But I totally love this new one even more than my old one!"
"I have a friend who snores very loud & we share a room when we travel together. I bought this in 2021. I use an app to play outdoors sounds. It fits comfortably & is nice and soft on your face. You can feel where the speakers are over your ears & it isn't too bad. I like how you can adjust the volume & shut it off from the front of the face mask without having to take it off & use your cell phone. I've had to turn the volume up when I've woken up & can hear the snoring. The only bad thing is if someone calls you while your using it, it rings in your ears!! lol But I bet if you put do not disturb on, on your cell phone then you won't be woken up.It's easy to travel with, you plug it in to charge it & it comes in a nice travel bag.I don't think you'd be disappointed in this product. :-)"
"They sit on and around my face very comfortably and do not squish my eyes at all. I can take a nap with my makeup on and eye makeup doesn't get all smudged. I don't have any light intrusion around any of the edges unlike some other masks I've tried. They are durable and so far they have held up great. Fit is snug enough without being too tight and don't slide up my head while sleeping. When I wake up the mask is where it's supposed to be and have not slide up and/or off my head. The Bluetooth part is easy to use and connect. I can hear through the speakers great.I have finally found something that allows me to sleep and allows my husband to have the TV on through the night. I used to wake up to loud parts of whatever he was watching or flashes of light from the tv but now just wearing this and having my ears covered allows me to stay asleep. We have a volume limit for the TV at night (volume of 10 for a Samsung tv) and the mask covering my ears without speakers of mask turned on allows enough block from TV's sound for when my audio has already turned off due to my sleep settings in whatever app I'm using.I've noticed that I need to disconnect from the mask during the day otherwise my phone tries to play my music or audiobook through the mask speakers when I'm in my house. Not an issue, just need to get used to it.Highly recommend!"
I bought these to replace my previous sleeping headphones which were the headband style instead of sleep mask and they were awful. I love that these are adjustable which is nice for those of us with smaller heads and the eye mask is very comfortable and blocks out the light. The earbuds don't hurt my ears at all even laying on my side and the sound is clear even laying on my back. You can also slide them around to where you want on the sides. I can't speak to the noise cancellation because I haven't needed that feature but I didn't hear my fan that runs at night with them on. I don't know if they'd block out a partner's snore or a TV.
"I had the eye mask for a while now. It's comfortable, and I like adjusting the size to fit snugly on my face. The headphones are light and can move around to be placed precisely to hear the audio. Bluetooth connects smoothly to my phone, so I'm glad I didn't have issues. I accidentally ran mine through the washer with the headphones still on, so I purchased another pair."
"I am enjoying my sleep mask! Good quality and fits well. Suppose I don't sleep well the night before; I pop on my sleep mask and nap during the day. I thought about getting a blackout shade, but this works just as well. The sound quality is excellent, too. It's a win for me."
"My hubby bought me this in 2021, this month the right speaker went out…. I have used these and loved them every single night for two years!!! They are absolutely worth the purchase and will definitely help with a great night sleep. They are super comfy the way they form to your eyes but aren't harsh. The speakers are just big enough to hear but don't hurt. And they charge well. Thousand percent recommended"
"I have sleep issues, and this sleep mask has been a big help. The built-in Bluetooth speakers are a big plus for me. They are not loud, nor sound-cancelling, but personally I wouldn't want them to be. No issues syncing with my iPhone and my Win11 PC."
"I've been using audio to help me sleep some nights for a long time and I've found it beneficial. Whether from the body being restless or sore or the mind being active or stressed, sound files (such as Brain.fm or long tracks on Insight Timer and other tracks, some with binaural beats, others without) have been very beneficial. But they've always come with one problem: the headphones/earbuds.Unless you sleep alone, you have to use a listening device to not bug your housemate(s). If you're a constant back sleeper, a bluetooth headset with a long enough battery life could work OK, but even then it can be uncomfortable to wear them for 6-9 hours - especially the earbuds. If you're a side sleeper or stomach sleeper at all (like me) those become very uncomfortable and painful after just a short time because of the pressure of being between your ear and the pillow where all the weight of your head is on one of them.Plus, they easily slip out. And if they have any wire, they get tangled up.This product solves that.By taking the speakers out of the ear, there isn't direct pressure inside anymore. Plus, they are kept in place inside the material.NOTE: I found if you place the speakers directly above your ear opening, it can still be a little uncomfortable after some time. It's still FAR better than regular earbuds/headphones. I found the best placement for me was to move them to the upper part of the band, still on my ear but at the top part. I turn the volume up just a bit more and can hear it plenty well and NO PAIN that way, even wearing it all night and sleeping on my sides/stomach most of the time.I've played with different volume levels and even with it turned up to where it would be a sleep inhibitor, my partner cannot even tell I'm listening to something. When it turn it down to a comfortable and effective level for me, it works great.It doesn't actually have noise cancellation technology, but it does an effective job of blocking out background noise. I put it at a level where I can still hear someone calling out or other really loud noises, but where I can also hear the audio program to be effective.EXCELLENT OVERLOOKED DESIGN FEATURE: For side/stomach sleepers, this is critical and is often overlooked. Other similar masks place the control unit (the power and control buttons) on the side. For side sleepers, this would be horrible. You'd be laying on it and it would apply pressure to your face and probably result in the buttons being pushed inadvertently. With this model, though, the control panel is front and center - which means it is out of the way for side sleepers and never gets accidentally pushed.And don't worry about the little red and blue lights in it. They are behind the material and are not an annoyance to anyone. Yet, they are still bright enough to be functionally useful when you need to see them. (The bright light from my Fitbit is about 1,000 times brighter and more annoying at night every time I move my arm.)And for me, the addition of the sleep mask is a nice bonus. I never used one before and didn't really need it, but thought I'd give it a try because I wanted the speakers out of my ears. The sleep mask is great, though. It's very comfortable and keeps cool and doesn't affect breathing at all. I've found it to be a wonderful bonus. I like to position it in such a way that just the smallest amount of light gets through the bottom, but you could position it for complete darkness if you wish.So, yeah, this is a great product! It's helped me enjoy sound sleep with the assistance of sound many nights - and without the pain in the ear from regular earbuds/headphones. It's got some great design features that make it very user friendly as well as bed-mate friendly. I highly recommend it, especially for side sleepers."
"This sleep mask is great. It blocks out 99.9% of the light, is soft and comfy, and is quiet enough that my husband doesn't hear my sleep meditation. The first Saturday I used it, I slept in until 10am. I haven't used melatonin in weeks. I've recommended it to several friends. I'm not giving it a 5 because the lights are difficult to see and it's not super easy to charge."
"I purchased this mask to wear while listening to ""bedtime"" stories. Its comfortable and definitely blocks the light. For that purpose it is one of the best masks I've tried. As too the sound quality, it seems okay for music but not for speaking. It was very difficult to understand the reader. That's a disappointment, but when I listen to music, it's okay."
"4 put of 5 stars. The volume isn't THAT great altho it is clear.  Definitely not cooling at all,However does stay on your head if tightened tight enough.Connects easily to phone too"
Was comfortable and the sound was good. I slept well with it
"The sound is great, really helps me sleep just one problem it's hard to wear in the summer time to warm."
"Works well so far after near daily use for about 2 weeks. Blocks light well, though sometimes a little may creep through the top. The placement of the speakers are adjustable. I haven't used the buttons yet except to power on/off. The concade space for lids allows room for lashes (of avg length anyway). Sound is good, though I often find myself wishing it were noise-cancelling (not doable for such a product, I know). All in all pretty decent. Though merely a cosmetic/vanity issue, they sent me the wrong blue (wanted teal, got navy)."
"From what I could tell, the sound quality was ok. But there were a couple things that caused me to return it. 1. If it was charging, even if powered off, it would keep audible saying ‘charging' every few seconds. Don't hear it well unless you hold it up to your ears, but you can hear something even if you're just in the room. It could have been operator error, but I couldn't figure it out. 2. Secondly, and the biggest reason I sent it back, if I want to uncover my eyes but still listen to the headphones, it wouldn't work because it wouldn't fit right. I wish it was more flexible so I could sometimes have my eyes uncovered and still listen to the headphones. That is personal preference, so nothing wrong with the actual quality of it in this point, but it was a deal breaker for me."
It provides great light blocking. The built in headphones are perfect for playing music. The only downside thus far is that the headphones pieces press against my ear uncomfortably when I sleep. As a side sleeper I was looking for a product that offered light blocking and noise-cancellation. The first night it was perfect but since I have to adjust several times to get it just right. Overall two thumbs up 👍.
Looks and feels great. Blocks out a ton of light. The headphones are nice too. I took off one star because it was a pain to get the blue tooth up and running.
"It's a little awkward to start but once it's fitted, it works great."
Edit*****. It quit working already.These headphones are very comfortable and I wear them every n Bluetooth to listen to a whitenoise app and it helps me sleep even better.  It definitely blocks out light.  The only issues I have had with them are things I think can easily be changed  with its design:1. It needs to have better adjustments for smaller heads. I am right at the end of the velcro and it still moves around a lot. But also hate all the extra thick fabric from the overlapping velcro getting all balled up as I sleep. Maybe do something similar to the strips that are on kids jeans to tighten.2. The charging cord is soo thin that it breaks easily.  This is my second set of this mask.  I carefully move it in its slot in the inside of the mask when I'm not charging but the cord broke on my first set.  I have a feeling this one will too.3. When its new it leaves lint pieces on your face every where for awhile.All in all I still highly recommend.
"These are good for getting sleep on nights when it is difficult to fall asleep. The sound lasts about 10 hours, so they don't wake me up after a few hours with a loud beep, to tell me that the battery is low. That's a good thing. They are comfortable to wear, but they don't work great with certain types of facemasks used with a CPAP. Other than that, they do the job that I want them to do."
"These cup the eyes really well, no light comes through. Long battery life and comfortable. The only complaint is the speaker quality but I wasn't expecting it. On time delivery."
"As a sleep mask it works great. The speakers are not noise canceling, but choosing the right music allows me to concentrate on pleasant sounds instead of whatever else is preventing me from falling asleep."
"I've been using these for about a week. I was surprised by the sound quality, which was much better than I expected. Some users have reported staining of pillow cases, I have not had that problem. I like the pads around the eyes as they are better at blocking light, especially if you pull them down further on your nose. There's a piece of material that comes down from the mask to provide further coverage. You can also move the speakers to align with your ears. The volume control on the mask works really well.I have this 4 stars because of the coverage and quality of speakers. I purchased it because it said it was washable. And it is...however, you have to thread the control unit out from the center of the mask. That means maneuvering it around the eye padding, which is not an easy task. I didn't even try it because I figured getting it back in would be a nightmare. I'll likely spot clean until I have time to deal with that.If I had a magic wand and could change this, I would make the control unit easier to remove by putting a slit at the top of the mask so you could easily slip the unit in and out. Also, I might put a wire or flexible material that allows you to pinch the nose coverage part tighter around your nose. I have a mask that has that feature, but doesn't have speakers."
"This mask has pads so that my false lashes didn't get smashed. It successfully drowns out the neighbors, my husband's snoring, the dogs, all of it. Completely blacks out all light. It's wonderful. The speakers are great, not too large so I can side-sleep. I listen to binaural beats and am able to get them loud or quiet enough to block out ambient noise.One little down-side: the dye comes off the mask onto your face. Yep, wake up refreshed, looking like a raccoon. It scrubs off easily enough, but that lasted for about a month, even after disassembling and washing the mask a few times.Oh and the velcro is designed for securing around the widest part of the head, but I fasten the mask around at the base of my head so I don't need nearly as much play."
"So I purchased the original design and loved it.After a year of use, one side of the headphones stopped working so I decided to buy another one from the same brand. This new one is a bit different from the first. Headphones now have a rubber covering rather than the felt-like covering and the mask feels softer so I was super excited for the update.Now for the reason I docked a star. After putting it in the wash and letting it dry, I went to bed with it and it felt really comfortable. However, the next morning I woke up to a mess on my face. This new version has some awful purple ink like discharge that went all over my face. Thankfully, with a wet towel it came off.I decided to hand wash it, and sure enough the soap turned purple while washing. I hand washed it 5 times, let it dry, and tried again. But still had a little bit (not as much) of purple on my face the next morning.I then machine washed it 2-3 more times, and just used the old mask with the new headphones for the time being. Finally, those several washes seemed to help.I do really like the quality and the headphones did last a year (hopefully this new version will too) but they definitely should consider making a 3rd version that doesn't have that weird purple ink residue.I decided to give a 4 star rather than 3 because after all those washes I don't have the issue anymore and it is really comfortable. And I'm also basing my rating off of the first pair which was great."
"I bought these to wear on our trip to Alaska during the midnight sun and they worked so well I now use them all the time.Pros:The mask is very soft and doesn't leave marks on your face. I actually wore these at the start of a migraine and the pressure was just right.I was able to use them two nights in a row before having to recharge them.They recharge very easily, the charging dock and the ear phones come out easily enough so you can hand wash the mask.Wide enough to cover your face and not allow for light to seep in.They easily connected to my iPhone 12 and any app that I wanted to use.The volume control was in the perfect location and was easy to use even when half asleepCons:The ear phones don't stay in place and move around.The strap to keep it in place seemed to be stretching out making it hard to keep in place, an easy fix, and could be a pro for a larger head or someone with a lot of hair.A few customers complained of the volume of the voice telling you that the battery was low. My solution to that was to discharge or let the battery run out after the second night and then do a full recharge. The only time I was woken by the voice I found it very easy to turn the set off and return to sleep, and I'm a very light sleeper."
"A pretty good mask with some design flaws. I use it often and I would overall recommend.The face of the mask is very comfortable, even with all the components. I also like the inclusion of some extra fabric to help block light around the nose. The least comfortable piece would probably be the headband, which seems made for people with a little more hair than I have. I have to velcro it much smaller than it was intended to get a snug fit, and even still it often slides off during the night as I'm sleeping. Thankfully, the velcro isn't terribly uncomfortable on my bald head, so i get to sleep just fine.Volume is better than I expected, although any bedmates will definitely hear anything above quarter volume.The components internal to the mask tend to move around somewhat. I noticed first when the control panel was not centered underneath its plate (and pushing the printed buttons did nothing at all), but had shifted to the center of the right eye. It was easy enough to move back, but it needs to be redone every few days. This was a little annoying, but it helped me to work through another qualm I had with the mask.Originally I found the speakers for the mask clear to listen to, but difficult to align with my ears. I was always shifting the mask a little to one side or the other to be able to hear in both ears. It turns out, the speakers can also be moved around within the mask! I was able to spread them out just a tad and now I can comfortably hear in both sides."
Love!! Perfect for use with headspace sleep casts
Comfortable and clear sound.
"The sound quality is very good, I listen to music and audio books. Sometimes the speakers move around inside the mask so it requires some finagling to get them in just the right spot. They are even comfortable while sleeping on my side. They do a really good job blocking light and the padding to prevent it from pressing directly on my eyes is also comfortable. The only thing that bothers me is that the strap on back of my head will slide down toward my neck, causing the whole thing to shift. Not sure how to improve that and it's not a game changer, just annoying sometimes. That said, this mask allows me to listen to something without disturbing my partner."
"Update : I received the replacement part.  I guess it was out of stock, so fingers crossed!!!! This is a very comfortable mask and only issue I had so far had been resolved.I purchased this and absolutely LOVED the feel of it.  It is super comfortable.  This worked amazing the first couple times I used it.  The charging port however in my headset was not charging and after charging it all day it would still say low battery.  Long story short it was just past the window to return through Amazon so I reached out to the company and they responded saying they would send the new charging and speaker element.  I responded a few times stating that would be terrific.  I never heard back from them after.  Needless to say I never received the replacement parts and just decided to purchase a different product with a different company. Great product with not too great customer service communication."
"overall i like this product, it's more comfortable to me than continuing to use earplugs with a plain sleeping mask. things i like are that if it's fully charged it'll last the whole night, even a long sleep, but if it isn't charged you will hear a voice telling you that the battery is low. i did come to realize this because the cord that came with it either didn't work or stopped working very quickly after i received the item so if you're having charging problems try another cord! i may try another design of sleep mask to have two on hand to make washing more convenient. plus the mask itself is more bulky that i'm used to and while it's comfortable enough to sleep i sometimes wake up with skin creases that i wouldn't have normally. i have had a little bit of redness and irritation around my eyes because i sleep on my side and the memory foam parts don't sit perfectly comfortably around them in that position but i apply some moisturizing cream and then a vaseline layer on top of the places i expect it to rub and that works well enough, it just means i'll have to wash them more often than i would another sleep mask. so far it's worth the 4 stars but another design might work better for me"
"These headphones are great. Connects really fast to Bluetooth and I'm surprised it can connect to two devices at the same time. I connected it to my phone and my computer which I used to play sleeping music, then I heard a phone call come through my headphones. I was surprised. So that's cool.But if you're in a warm environment, prepare to get sweaty 😰.In a cooler environment they are spot on. It just so happens I'm in a warm place and l have to put the fan on when sleeping. The sound is great once you use your fingers to make sure the speakers inside align with your ears.  I can still hear my environment even with them on (like the fan) unless I sleep on my side with one ear against the speaker and the other in the open. So there's not much noise canceling unless you reduce your environment noise.If you don't strap it tight enough around your head though, don't be surprised if it comes off while you're sleeping.Otherwise,"
Works as expected
"Fist pair worked well for over a year. Speaker placement is crucial for comfort and sound quality so the  built in ""envelope"" allows for custom fit which is great."
"I had one of these masks nearly identical but by a different brand. I love the Bluetooth sleep mask overall. The flat speakers aren't perfect; sometimes my ears get a little sore, but it's way better than ear buds. My last mask lasted a few years and then one of the speakers stopped working so I ordered this to replace the old one. This one was a few bucks cheaper than the other brand.I just got this one yesterday & haven't decided if I'm going to keep it for two reasons. First, the charging port frustrates me. On my old mask, the charging cable plugged right into the front control ‘box.' On this one though, there's a cord that has to be shoved into the mask to wear it & then pulled out of it in the morning to charge. Just not convenient.Second, the sound seems more muffled than with my last one. My last mask offered crisp sound through the speakers; this one I wonder if maybe the strap is thicker or something because the sound isn't as good."
"I love these mask and I did by one for my Mom, however I couldn't give it a 5 because of the uncomfortable indentation on the side of my head and ear. I woke up sore on my ears and head.  Not so happy with that. With more padding in that area.  A5 all the way as the are so comfy and fit perfectly with the velcro.  Just watch your hair.  I use a cap to put it on and then slip the cap off. It works keeping your lung hair in place and acts as a cap.  Double bonus.  I just can't where them to sleep until after I removed the speaker.  Thankfully.  I have their sunglasses and they are perfect as well. It's total black out. Perfect.  With perfect sound and control of sound. Highly recommended.  Just be aware of your sensitivity to impressions made easily.  For me it's only because I am a TBI survivor and highly sensitive on my skull. Not everyone will feel uncomfortable. It's the only reason I have a 4. I hope purple like myself that read reviews and trust them. Wanted to just give a heads up before.  I had mine adjusted/ taken out.  And i love, love, love them.  Helps block outside sounds as well.  Great product.  Well made.  Have bought 2 already and intend to buy more for gifts."
"I discovered these headphones and I mask combinations when my godson's came to visit a year ago. I've read the reviews and I know that there have been a lot of mixed ones so I guess I'm just adding my two cents at this point… I've had nothing but positive things to say! The mask is durable, adjustable, and very comfortable. I have slept on my back, and my side, both sides, with this mask I do not find that your phone that is in the mask to be uncomfortable honestly, if it was uncomfortable that your phones do move and slide in the sleeves for positioning so I could slide them up if, if they were uncomfortable… However, they're not. Charging is easy and the Bluetooth has worked great. I've been using them every night since I purchased us, it helps with drowning out my husband‘s snoring. But, these are not noise canceling. I can still hear him and our TV. I wish the volume went up just a little more on these headphones, but overall, I am very pleased with this product, and find it a great asset for such little money."
