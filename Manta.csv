"I bought this in hopes it would work well with my CPAP mask. It works fairly well, but really no better than a $6 mask. There still is just as much light bleed through the CPAP itself, no matter how I line up the eye pads.Unfortunately, it has recently started to have an uncomfortable issue on the back. The strap has thinned to the point where the Velcro attaches that it leaves a wide swath to stab into the back of my neck, and I can't get it to fully cover no matter what I do.It's also getting worn out to the point that I'm worried it won't even last another six months. It just seems that something this expensive should last significantly longer, and be much higher quality."
Couldn't position correctly over my headgear for my breathing machine. Also didn't like that I was strapped in with some many different straps. From the machine and from this thing . Maybe consider a strapless design.
"Totally disappointed in this product. None of the claims they make were true for me:1. NOT snag-free: it's a velcro fastener that snags my hair every single time.2. NOT 100% blackout: no matter how I adjust the cups, there is always light leaking through the nose area or the top or both.3. NOT comfortable: The cups are huge and press my face when sleeping on the side. Pretty much no stretch to the strap, so it's always either too tight or too loose. Not that breathable -- my eye area got sweaty and hot.4. NOT ""deepest possible sleep"": with all discomforts above, I slept worse than usual."
"I like the adjustment feature but better materials should have been used, considering the cost of mask. The cotton eye pieces irritate the skin and hold heat to the point of sweating. The Velcro band is a little too thick making it awkward and uncomfortable to move around. These are good for total black out and little else. Save your money."
"Well made, but where the velcro meshes together is simply far too thick and made it too uncomfortable for me to sleep with. I think there was a brand logo where the straps meet that is WAY too thick and makes sleeping with this really uncomfortable. I felt like there was a big bump underneath my head when I would lay down. I'm someone that gets hyperfocused on different things when I sleep so if there's anything bothering me/stimulating me I won't be able to sleep (hence why I was buying the mask in the first place, even small amounts of light make it difficult for me to sleep)It's a shame, as the rest of the mask is really soft and clearly well put together. Had to wind up returning it as I couldn't use it."
"I bought this based on the glowing recommendations on the site. However, upon using it, I noticed that it's really not a good product for side sleepers.The mask fits perfectly when you're on your back, however, when you turn on your side, your pillow will push on the mask, thus creating gap that allows light in. It also creates extra pressure, as the pillow would push on the side of the cup and you would feel the cup pressed against your face on one side.Lastly, due to the way it fits, I have yet to have the mask stay on the entire night. I've been using it for multiple nights now, and without fail I've woken up without the mask every time. Whereas, for other lower profile masks, they would always stay on.So, if you're a back sleeper I'd recommend it, but otherwise, I'd find something else."
Didn't like them way too bulky
"I bought this and the MZOO sleep mask. Tbe only way to block all the light was to have it on very tight. I couldn't do it but it was a little tight, my eyes hurt, I slept terribly. The MZOO sleep mask worked much better. I'm not using this one again. It was expensive so it's unfortunate!"
wont stay on my eyes  moves around way to much  and the eye cups leak in light...sucks for the price you would think someone  made something that works
"I can indeed get 100% blackout with these, but the catch is that to do it I need to make the mask so tight that it's really uncomfortable. Also, the velcro fasteners for the eye cups are kind of a double-edged sword- in theory they provide infinite customizability for placing them on the mask, but in practice they make it impossible to dial in their position precisely. For example, you can't really move one of them 1/16th of an inch to block a little sliver of light because as soon as you tear off the velcro, you can't tell exactly where it was to begin with. Finally, the pressure of the eye cups on the top of my nose makes my sinuses hurt. If through sheer luck (because of the velcro) I happen to find a position for the eye cups that alleviates any of these issues then I'll update my review."
"This is a very well constructed sleep mask. No issues with the materials or quality, its exactly as advertised. However the qualm I had was with the fact I'm a side sleeper and this mask is too bulky for my head against the pillow. It became uncomfortable and not easy to get used to.I am recommending this for back sleepers though. It will work perfect for you."
"I was very excited to get these, but was very disappointed that they are painful when side sleeping. They are amazing at blocking out light. They are perfect for planes or sleeping on you back."
"Blackout = 5 stars.  It's impressiveSoftness = 5 stars.  It's waaaaay softComfort = 0 stars.  It's not.  The velcro attachment overlaps and is bulky behind the head. Laying on my side, it squishes up my face and is impossible to sleep with it on."
"It's unbelievably hard to get it just right to fit my face, almost needs a second person to assist in the setup.I'm sure one day I'll get to a total blackout with this, but really - just go with Mindfold mask which I tried to replace with this Manta."
Too bulky. I could feel the strap on the sides of my head and behind it as well. I tore it off in the middle of the night because it was keeping me awake.
I was disappointed. In order to get it from blocking out all the light it has to be way too tight. Wish the top mask part was larger to help with this. Thought it would be better based in the other reviews.
"This mask is probably more effective for back sleepers.  I am a side sleeper.  While the raised eye area keeps the mask from resting on your eyes, the mask felt like I was lying on a rock.  It was very uncomfortable when lying on my side."
"Bought as a replace for a very similar mask that is no longer available. Found the Manta mask to be very lightweight. I would not describe this as ""weighted"". They eye cups are smaller than other masks but work ok with some positioning. Not as snug as a fit as others I've used but it works."
Side sleepers may find the cups press uncomfortably below the eye.  It digs into the soft area underneath the eye pushing on eye the ball.
Personally I found them to be too tight around my eyes.
"My previous sleep mask put pressure on my eyes so I thought I would try this, now I have pressure around my eyes which is worse to me. I also do not like the thick strap where both sides connect. It does block the light."
"I love this mask. It's completely changed the way I sleep. In fact, I've bought four of them…But that's the problem. I've bought four of them, because the Velcro is awful. If you attach this in the same location each night (as I assume most of us do as our heads are not drastically changing size into adulthood), then the Velcro wears out within months. I think I'm going to replace the Velcro on mine with something sturdier because I love the overall mask so much…but I shouldn't have to. It would be such an easy fix, and potentially not even more expensive. Such a bummer, because I'd probably buy a wider variety of these if I wasn't spending all of my money to replace Velcro."
"It does, indeed, provide total blackout, but it is THE most uncomfortable sleep mask I've tried, out of about 12. It's so heavy. I've tried to sleep with it for about two weeks and I never make it to dawn without ripping it off my face, as I discover when the light wakes me up."
"it's quite hard to review this product, it's good, but it's also mediocre.the pros are, it's indeed soft. even if you tighten the strap, you can feel the pressure around your eyes, they are still quite comfortable to wear. they look good and stylish. they are sturdy. the c cup feature made this mask significantly superior than others.cons are, if you move around while sleep, the strap can be moved away from the crown of the head, which can cause uncomfortable sensation, with moved strap, mask position can also be affected (light leaking in). So i usually find myself tensed up trying to no move able while sleep, which causes muscle fatique. another con is the straps are too thick. also"
"I will say this mask is constructed of quality materials. If you are SOLELY a back sleeper or want to us it for travel, this mask is a good option. However, if you are a side sleeper, the mask is NOT comfortable at all as the oversized sockets which offer ""zero eye pressure"" actually create a great deal of eye pressure. I will be sticking with the $10 gel masks as they are much more comfortable for me as someone that always sleeps on one side or the other."
"First this thing is hot. So much foam around your eyes!It is almost too adjustable. The eye cups are peel and stick Velcro which makes it almost impossible to get the fit correct. I found that once I finally got them in the ""right place"" there were still light leaks unless I tightened the strap to an uncomfortable pressure."
Bought my first manta mask from touch of modern as a prototype. The eye sockets were large and roomy. The second and third replacements were also good but this last one the eye cups are smaller and they press on the eyeball if you lay on your tummy.
For my particular purposes I want a sleep mask that accomplishes the following:1. Blocks all light.2. Has enough room for blinking.3. Comfortable4. Can be slid down over the eyes without much adjustment for very quick use.5. Can be worn with large over ear headphones.1. ✓ Can block all light after a good bit of adjusting.2. ✓ Has enough room to not contact eyelashes.3. 𐄂 Needed to be tightened to the point that it isn't comfortable to block all light.4  𐄂 Needs too much adjusting to put on quickly.5. ✓ Doesn't interfere too much with the pads of my particular headphones.
"Blocks light and would be great if I slept motionless on my back.  But once I switch to my side the mask shifts position on my face and is both uncomfortable and no longer functions properly.  Also, velcro clasp creates a noticeable bump on the strap at the back of my head.  Will be returning."
Bought this after my BON Charge sleep mask Velcro broke and it was $15 cheaper. Not worth it. BON Charge's sleep mask doesn't even feel like you are wearing it and much more comfortable than this one. This is thick and not as cushioned. I wore so couldn't return it. Next time I'm spending the extra money and getting myself a new BON Charge one.
"I wear an eye mask every night. But I also use a CPAP machine. Many masks I've tried, end up letting in some light because it does not fit over my CPAP mask very well. I am happy to report that this particular eye mask does fit well even when wearing a C-PAP, yay!Initially, it was a little tricky figuring out how to put the foam parts for the eye in the right spot on the velcro mask part. So what I did is lay down, put the foam Parts over my eyes how I like them, and then gently put the velcro Mask Part on top so it sticks in the right place. Had to adjust it just a tiny bit, but now it's perfect!Being able to move the foam eye pieces around as needed, to fit your face exactly how you want it is an awesome feature! Been using it for about a week now and very happy with it. Hopefully the velcro holds up for a long time!"
They were super comfortable and completely effective during my travels to the lands of midnight sun. I will bring these on all my travels from now on.
"I got this in the mail yesterday and used it for the first time last night. I wear a full face Cpap mask, exactly like the one I included a photo of. These fit nicely on my face under the Cpap which helped make sure it stayed in place all night, even with my tossing and turning. I'm a side sleeper mostly and these worked great. Complete blackout. I've tried many other masks before and they always come off over night. Even without the Cpap mask  helping hold it in place I think that it still would've stayed on. I have very long natural lashes and hate how I can't blink with most masks on. That's not a problem with these! I was able to blink without issue. And I know that the company has more eye cups you can buy on their site, one of which is an even deeper eye area in case you might need that.I bought these partially because I need completely darkness to sleep but also to wear after my upcoming Lasik appointment next week. I wanted to make sure I couldn't rub my eyes in my sleep. And that the air from my Cpap mask didn't dry my eyes out even more than they are going to be already.I will try and remember to update this after more use."
"Had a 17-hour travel day to Israel.  I've used many eye masks, but this one tops them all!!"
No pressure on your eyes and it really does block 100% of light.It's also light weight. very comfortable.
I'm impressed in the quality and design. My only dislike is the mild pressure I feel on the back of my ears where the strap rests around my head.
I thrilled with the product. This let's me sleep and wake naturally.The best!
Game changer. I hate sleeping without it now
"This is the best sleep mask I have ever owned, it blocks out all light, super comfy, fully washable.  You cannot go wrong with this mask."
It worked great! I used it for sleeping on the plane and Hotel.  I did sweat some but the mask absorbed the sweat.
"I was advised by my doctor to buy a cupped eye mask for my thyroid eye disease. my lids would not fully close at night when sleeping so i would wake up with dry, crusty, painful eyes and frequent styes. i got this mask, and another mask with a flatter cup, shortly after getting punctal plugs installed in my tear ducts. i have to say that the masks function just as effectively, if not more so, than the punctal plugs. my punctal plugs fell out so i can compare mask use both with and without the plugs, and can safely say the mask does most of the work. i can't sleep without the masks. if i do, or if they come off at night, then i wake up with my eyes feeling absolutely butchered. i can't believe i didn't buy this sooner. if you have thyroid eye disease then don't hesitate - buy this mask (or any other cupped eye mask). i like that the eye cups are removable and adjustable with velcro, and the head strap is also velcro adjustable. for the most part, it is comfortable and completely blocks light. my eyes are not nearly as dry as they use to be upon waking up. i can't sleep without it now.i will go into the cons now - for this particular model, i found that the cup padding would press into my sinus/nose bridge and could interfere with breathing comfort a little. but the trade off is worth it. on days when i feel extra sensitive, or more asthmatic, and it bothers me too much, then i will switch out this mask for a more lightweight model. sometimes the mask comes off my face at night and i am not sure if it's me pushing it off, or it coming off by itself. sometimes it does get a little warm, so maybe unknowingly, in my sleep, i end up pushing it off. i often rotate between this eye mask, and the ones with less defined eye cups. but having the eye cup is key as a flat, standard mask wont cut it. if you are a side sleeper, then the cups might end up being pushed around a bit, especially if you move around a lot when you sleep.whether you choose this particular model or another one i am sure you will find relief. totally worth the money, cheaper than punctal plugs, and works just as well, if not better, than the punctal plugs. keeps my eyes from drying out completely in my sleep and it improves my sleep quality. even though my ted has improved with medication i will still continue to sleep with this mask on, especially in winter with the heat on causing dryness. sad that this isn't sold in pharmacies or covered by insurance, it's truly an eye-saver. love it."
"Before you could buy it on Amazon, I got it direct from manufacturer. Years later, I find the quality to be not quite as good. It still works just fine. Better than competition, that's for sure. Its just that something is off about it, but not sure what."
"As eyemasks go, these were nearly perfect. The little eye pockets are adjustable, which allows them to be moved to fit your face better. I loved that! they are soft and do an excellent job blocking out light if you don't have to wear a CPAP mask.Sadly, I needed them to work with my CPAP machine mask (I use a nostril pillow), and I couldn't find a way to adjust the eyes to work properly with my mask straps. I had to return them. I have a small face, so that may be the problem for me, personally. I had to return these. They just didn't work with my mask and my face."
"The Manta Sleep Mask is a reliable choice for blocking out light, earning a solid 4-star rating from me. This eye mask does a great job of creating a dark environment for uninterrupted sleep. However, I did encounter some difficulty in positioning the cups to completely block light around my nose. Despite this minor challenge, the overall light-blocking effectiveness of the mask makes it a worthwhile purchase for those seeking a peaceful sleep experience."
"Very good quality and blocks light really well when I'm on my back, but unfortunately I'm a side sleeper. The eye cups are very firm and square-edged, so when I turn on my side they push away from my face and let light in."
"I've been using this for a month. I've got pretty significant dry eyes.  And I sleep a lot on my side or even stomach, sometimes poking my eyes or putting pressure on them.This helped a lot. First, it essentially prevents you from stomach sleeping very much as that usually knocks it off.  The first few nights I would wake up and not even be able to find the mask.Then, with slide sleeping its a little better. I still wake up with the mask pushed off my eyes at least once a night though.But most of the time, it works pretty well. Over time I spend more time sleeping on my back or at sort of a slightly less angle then on the side, and the mask stays on a little more every night.And it does help with dry eyes.  Not totally of course but somewhat helpful.The price is ridiculous.  Its less than a dollars of some overseas material.  I expect that will plummet as more clones appear.  But for now its pretty good.  It is hard to adjust the velcro to get the eye cups just right but then it stays like that."
"Great: The deeper eye sockets are nice. I have long eyelashes and other well-reviewed masks were a problem if I happened to blink. These are deep, dark and comfortable.Improvement opportunity: The strap is too thick on the back of my head. It's uncomfortable against my pillow if I'm on my back, which I how I prefer to sleep with a mask on. Make the strap as thin as possible, and slightly wider so it's got more area to hold onto. If you have to keep the velcro, make it attach on the side, and make the choice of side adjustable."
"The material for this is definitely comfortable and while it is true that this mask can cover practically any peaking light, this is achievable only with a certain fit. This is something I'd probably more so recommend to someone who's on a flight or traveling as this is not exactly the most comfortable-fitting mask when you wear it to actually block all light from peaking. As someone else mentioned, you basically have to wear this tight enough for the mask to actually fit well enough to cover your particular contour which only then allows the mask to do its job—at which point it is no longer comfy to wear. Otherwise it's not different than any other $5 sleep mask. This kind of requirement is why I would recommend this for someone on a plane who isn't really being guaranteed any place of comfort and would actually reap the most benefit from this design. There is a trick I have discovered when wearing this in bed where I have managed to adjust the coverage of the mask by wearing it barely tight and making sure the band is not actually going below the ears. I can do this on most nights and if I keep my head still, the mask will kind of get tugged from being squished between my head and my pillow and will kind of force itself down from the actual mask part. This is arguably the only way I've been able to sleep comfortably with this thing but it is something I found out by really struggling with it for a month or so. The only reason this is not lower than 4 stars is because as stated before, this particular mask is manufactured pretty well and the material is comfortable albeit probably not so much in the warmer seasons/climates. This mask IS washer friendly as I've washed it several times and it has not lost it's shape. Basically, the mask is the closest any producer can get to achieving pitch black sleep while maintaining max comfort. Unless you don't mind having a tight mask to get guaranteed pitch black sleep, this is for you. Otherwise, I'd cut your losses and put up with a cheaper mask that will pretty much give you the same coverage for the same comfort/lower price."
I am OBSESSED with this mask!! But I bought it in May of 2022 and I need a new one less than a year later. The Velcro on the back no longer sticks. I'm so sad about this. I will order another one though bc it's the BEST one on the market for a ton of reasons! It would get 10 stars if the Velcro lasted longer. Here are the other reasons it amazing.-no pressure on my eyes-complete black out-cushion over my ears (no pressure)-washable-adjustable eye cups for all shapes and sizes of faces-hair doesn't get stuck in the Velcro on the backBuy this mask. But just know you'll have to buy another one in about 9 months if you use it daily.
To block light and wind out. It's also super nice to be able to adjust the position of the pads to cover directly where your eyes are if they happen to be offset when you get them (simple peel off and apply Velcro function)I'd recommend this to people who like sleep masks or feel the need for one.
"Difficult to sleep on your side or stomach with this on. The eye-cups are very bulgy. I'd recommend getting a standard silk one. With a more standard silk one, you will feel a bit of pressure on your eyes, but you will adjust to it if you keep using it (I've gotten to the point that I actually prefer having it on, even in very dark rooms where it is not needed)."
"Wish I could un-buy this. Comes off every night, and the thick eye pieces prohibit anything other than back sleeping. Also, if you lie any way other than on your back, pressure against the mask shifts it and causes light leaks. Overall, just not effective as an all night sleep solution."
not comfortable for sleeping
"I have tried wearing this mask over my ears and above my ears and nothing is comfortable. You can either have your ears pinned or the strap digs into crease of your ear.If you opt for pinning your ears, you will wake up to the mask on your nose and temple instead of your eyes.Sleeping in your side also causes some eye socket pressure from the pads.At least it blocks light.Seeing all the good reviews honestly makes me question my reality 😅"
A couple pieces of foam and a few stitched pieces of velvet with a velcro strip. A basic version could be made with a $5.00 trip to an arts and crafts store but made in China and sold for the bargain price of $35.00. Doesn't really fit or work for me.
"These aren't the best for a side sleeper. That being said, they work well at the start. I've had mine 6 months and the eyecups lose their supportiveness and the cups can invert, resulting in them brushing your lashes/eyelids which can be annoying.These are better for my eye issues than the regular sleep masks. I wish the eye cups were made of sturdier materials and maybe a stiff eye cover inside the fabric that doesn't invert. This way, if you end up turning face down into the pillow, the mask doesn't completely depress onto your eyes.I also wish the strap was more clingy and had a wider part in the back to cradle the back of your head more."
Uncomfortable when you sleep on your side. It bunches up. Woke up with sore temples. Wouldn't recommend. Plain silk masks work better
"Despite the claim that this mask was great for side sleepers, it definitely was not the case for me.  It smushed into my temple, for starters, and it didn't stay in place whatsoever.  Maybe it would have if I had had it super tight, but I started with it really tight and that wasn't comfortable at all.  Loosening it a little bit made it feel like it was still mostly snug, but when I woke up in the middle of the night, it was completely shifted and was no longer covering my eyes.  I had high hopes, but I returned it the next day."
"The cups are firm and stick out pretty far so when your head is against the pillow, you're laying on top of half of one of the eye cups. This cup exerts a lot of force on the temple and brow of the skull. When I wake up, the mask is still in place and it blocks out light insanely well but the side of my head hurts because of the pressure against one side of my head all night. This mask would be amazing for any back sleepers, but you definitely shouldn't buy it if you're a side or front sleeper"
I read all the reviews for this sleep mask and was hoping it would be right for me. Unfortunately it is too large and uncomfortable for me to use. I tried it one night and couldn't sleep. Not for me.
Blocks out light and no pressure points on my face
"As someone who is very sensitive to light when trying to sleep, I've tried countless sleep masks over the years, but this one is truly the best I've ever used. The adjustable strap ensures a perfect fit and the mask itself is incredibly soft and comfortable against my skin. It also provides total blackout, even when my wife insists on watching TV in bed. The contoured eye cups design keeps the mask from pressing against my eyes or face, so I don't wake up with any redness or marks. I've even noticed that the mask helps me fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Overall, I am so impressed with the Manta Sleep Mask and I would highly recommend it to anyone who struggles with light sensitivity or trouble sleeping. It's definitely worth the investment for the quality and comfort it provides."
I really enjoy the eye cups! I can fully open my eyes while eating the mask and it makes it feel like the room is 100% dark! Very comfortable.
"I've used a fair amount of sleep masks, and this one is the only one I've used that does what it says it does: 100% blackout. It's beautiful. These eye cups cradle your eyes like sweet baby angels cupping their tiny hands over your eyes all night. But instead of exploiting child labor, this mask works for free (after purchase of course). Ambient light is one of the worst things for your sleep, and sleep is one of the best things you can do for yourself. SO: you, yeah you, cough up the dough and buy this thing. It's worth it.I'm mostly a side sleeper, and while it does take some adjusting to get this thing positioned right, it doesn't bow out like the cheaper ones and let in light over the nose bridge. And it definitely doesn't press down on your eyes. I can even blink in this thing and not feel my lashes rub against the cups. This thing also holds up in the wash (if you use the mesh bag it comes in to wash it), and that's great. I sleep like a rock with this thing on. Not THE Rock, but LIKE a rock. Maybe like the Rock, too. On that note, it's not all about drive and power, it's also about a good night's sleep, and this mask will provide. Sleep is the one thing you can't afford to sacrifice, so I think this slightly-more-expensive mask is worth it.The one caveat: if you have a massive head, first realize that it doesn't mean you have a better brain (it's probably actually less efficient than smaller-headed people), but second, this mask miiiight not fit comfortably. I like to wear it looser so I don't notice it as much while I sleep, so if you plan on that too, keep this info in mind. With easy returns, it's definitely 100% worth a shot!"
"I purchased these since I was having severe (and painful) morning dry eye.  I may suffer from nocturnal lagophthalmos which is a condition whereby your eyes open slightly when sleeping.  These kept my eyes from drying out.  My eyes are nice and moist this morning and I did not even have to apply eye drops (which is my ususal routine).  I have thrown away several black-out masks that use the soft ring (or cup-like feature) that is intended to keep mask material away from your eyelids.  The problem I have found with some is that the ""cups""  feel like suction cups on my eyes and are very uncomfortable.  Not these.  They are very gentle around the eye socket even when laying on your side.  I have also rejected sleep masks with adjustment buckles since I find these to also be uncomfortable in certain positions.  So I'm very happy these adjust with velcro and incorporate some elastic so they can easily be removed without having to re-adjust the velcro each time.  I think these were very well thought-out by somebody and this is why they are so popular.  I was not paid or compensated in any way for this review."
"This product changed my life! If you have tried a cheap sleep mask and found it helpful, then you will love this. Nuff said.Lefty"
"I have been with Manta since inception when it was offered as a crowd fund item. I loved the initial creation, however this item is even better.Stitching and quality are superb, fit is excellent. I own 2, and take one wherever I go. Fit is simple to change/adjust and there is plenty of room for above average eyelashes."
"Fantastic.  Been using it nearly every day since I got it.  Reallys helps when taking naps, especially during car rides.  Can get a little hot and annoying some nights.  But, easily the best eye mask I've tried."
"Purchased as a gift for the wife. She typically uses a sleep mask but requested this type. She reports that it is very comfortable, and she sleeps better with less pressure on her eyes."
"Normally, I use the silk eye masks for sleeping, but these are actually way more comfortable, butter soft, and able to open your eyes with them on and still be comfortable and fully dark even when the lights are on in the room."
"I've gotten lazy about writing reviews. However this product is so fantastic I must. It's worth telling others. Finally a soft, comfortable mask that doesn't put any pressure on your eyes!  Instead the super soft eye cups protect your precious peepers!  Ladies that invest in lashes. These cups over your eyes leave plenty of room for fake lashes that will still look amazing in the morning 😊. I love they're washable. I've already put them through once and no pilling or falling apart. I saw these on a YouTube channel called Flora & Note.  They do a food travel show. On one episode they were showing off these masks they love when traveling ( especially planes). It's 100% blackout. I don't get any side light. Perfect darkness.  I know the cups look like they sit high off your face. It's all comfy.  Husband loved mine so much he got a pair as well. Two thumbs up👍👍"
"Perhaps you think a less expensive type of mask will work. Hell, maybe you think you don't need a mask at all to sleep.I'm here to tell you that you're wrong.Would you pay $30 for one months worth of better sleep? How about $0.50 a night? $0.25? Because that's what's going to happen. The longer you use this mask, the less expensive the investment.I bought this mask a month ago, after having just purchased a different mask. I've only worn the manta mask since I purchased them both. And I've only woken up once in the night. All month long. And that was only because I had to pee.This mask cradles your face in a soft snuggle. Everything is adjustable, so it will fit your face just right. This has not one square inch of Velcro, so it will not snag your hair or your linens, and it will not scratch your face. The eye cups are adjustable, so they are floating precisely over your eyes without pressing on them. Everything is washable, so no grossness near your eyes. It comes with a case/laundry bag. Make sure you inspect all the pockets, because surprise! there is a pair of the best fitting, incredibly quieting ear plugs. They knocked out about 90% of the fireworks and 100% of my neighbors' arguments, which has really been impeding my ability to sleep.Other options are available, like a weighted mask, cooling or warming eye cups, aromatherapy, and a whole line of things that will make you sleep like a cat in the sun. I'm also getting a weighted headband and a body pillow (I'm a side sleeper). The great news is I don't need to buy new eye cups. When building your dossier of manta products, you only need to purchase what you need since everything magically (without any Velcro) attaches and detaches from the mask.Today, I'm going to live my life because I got amazing sleep with my manta eye mask."
"I am a sensitive sleeper, primarily with regard to light in my eyes when I'm trying to sleep. This sleep mask has consistently delivered a quality blackout experience since I started using it a few weeks ago. I like the eye cups because I can reposition them as needed and the hollow area relieves the eye pressure most sleep masks cause. The quality of the fabric is great, very soft, and the headband is adjustable and comfortable - something I struggle with because I have sensitive skin. Overall, it's a great addition to my sleep routine - so much so that I've slept through my alarm a couple of times, just because I was so comfortable and deeply asleep in the dark :)Oh, a note for side or stomach sleepers (I sleep in the freefall position): I have no issues with light leaking on either my side or my stomach sleeping positions. I've read other reviews that mention issues with these particular positions, but I've had no problems."
"I have been using sleep masks for about 10 years. I always search for something comfortable with full blackout capabilities. I have to look no further. I use a CPAP at night with a ResMed N30i nasal mask and this sleep mask still fits.I felt it was a bit pricey. But I have issues with my eyelashes not growing straight out anymore. I thought it may be because my old masks would rub on my face during the night. It was worth the lil but extra for the max cushions to ensure when I moved around my lashes would be ok. I have been using this mask for about two weeks now. I feel as though that issue is almost nonexistent if not completely resolved. I brush my lashes everyday and I believe I have begun to notice them getting back to normal.Even if you do not feel like you need the max version, this brand is still the best since the eye cushions are adjustable. I will probably never look for another brand again. I just hope the Velcro holds up since I prefer adjustable straps with a buckle."
"I've found the perfect sleep mask. I honestly was very hesitant to spend the money on it, as I had tried other brands and had little satisfaction. But with those cheaper ones light was still getting in and if I tried to adjust it to block out the light it put dangerous and uncomfortable pressure on my eyes. I kept seeing ads for these things, because your phone knows everything about you, so after about 7 months or so, I bit the bullet. I figured buying it from Amazon would allow me to return it should it not fit right. I'm an adult with a pretty tiny head. Like, I have to wear kids glasses frames & kids face masks, tiny. It's very hard to find things that fit properly. But this adjusts small enough for my small head. It also allows you to move the eye pieces to make sure your eyes are cupped perfectly.  It puts zero pressure on your eyes as well. I just bought a second one through the companies website and I'm looking at getting a third.  I like to have back hps of things I really like and that fit right because you never know when or if they will go out of production. Plus, I travel a lot and it's nice to know I can grab one and go without worrying about trying to find it in my bag as soon as I get home because I'm tired after a long drive. The material is so soft. It's just the most comfortable sleep mask I've ever tried."
"I love this mask. It's really comfortable on my face and doesn't feel like I'm wearing a restrictive mask over my eyes. The cushions which go around the eyes are really comfortable to wear. Other masks I've worn over the years gave me a headache when I woke up in the morning. This one doesn't even feel like it's on my face! Because I work night shift, this mask is a requirement for me to sleep in the day. Absolutely ZERO light comes into the mask, allowing me to get ""night time"" sleep. I've also used it while flying, and it's amazing for this application too! I will never buy another sleeping mask again!"
"I slipped this bad boy on and fell into a sleep so deep and so sound that I woke up panicked, completely sure that I had slept through a very important exam... only to remember - wait, no - I am 31 years old, nearly a decade out of school, and I no longer have to take exams.  This sleep mask has literally taken years off of my life.  The cups are soft foam and completely block out all light, yet they're raised enough so I feel like the eyelashes that I pay way too much money for are free to flutter around unobstructed when I'm deep in a REM cycle.  I also have my Manta mask tightened ever so slightly to give just the tiniest bit of pressure... like a little Sleep Fairy is giving my face a delicate little hug.... and this has helped me to relax my forehead muscles and has reduced my tension headaches.  For that effect alone, I feel like buying another pair, cutting out the eye holes, and just wrapping the strap against my head Ninja-Turtle style during the day to combat migraines.I bought the thin strap because it completely overloads my senses to have my ears covered while I'm sleeping; I find this strap to be perfect in that it secures the mask to my head while not being overly intrusive or uncomfortable.  As far as aesthetics go.... my boyfriend probably doesn't love sleeping next to a bug-eyed fly at night.  But it doesn't really matter because when I have my Manta mask on, I can't see his face to know whether or not he grimaces at the sight of me.  And if he does grimace, too bad because I'll be asleep in 2 minutes flat, dreaming of a guy who has a thing for girls in Manta Masks."
Use every night! Super cozy
"UPDATE: I've had these for a couple of weeks and they slide off my head each night. Ugggh! They really do block out the light when you have them on though. I just wish they would stay on my head while I thrash around in my sleep haha.I am a side/back/and stomach sleeper (I wake up a lot!) and toss and turn constantly throughout the night. I've bought cheap sleep masks, fuzzy soft masks, silk masks, and the highly talked about Unimi mask that is #2 on Amazon.... and none of these masks have come close to the Manta!! Since I toss and turn so much, my mask ALWAYS comes off during the night causing me to wake up as soon as I see the sun coming up at 5am. Not fun. With the Manta, you can tighten it as tight as you want and move the eye cups to any position. Because I can tighten it as tight as I need and because of the soft velor-type texture on the inside, it doesn't slide off at all!! You have no idea how happy I am to actually get a full night's sleep at night wake up before the roosters in the morning haha! I've also attached a photo of a quarter inside the eye cup to show the depth of the eye cups. They are deep eye cups, and I have extra long eyelashes and can fully open my eyes without my eyelashes brushing up against the inside of the cups. The eye cups are also really soft which is a relief. Hopefully the eye cup cushions don't break down over time. We will see, but this will be the only mask I purchase in the future. I'm telling all of my friends!!"
no cap add this to your sleep stack fr
"Too stiff if you sleep on your side, covers eyes well, looks nice, materials could be softer or more plush. Probably ok for airplane travel in coach if you're sleeping sitting up."
"Sorry, but no matter how I adjusted the eye mask it still was never comfortable to me. Those eye cups left pressure marks around my eyes. Had to return this product."
"If you move around at all at night, this mask is not for you. It slides out of place too easily and disrupts your sleep more than light does. Wrapping a t-shirt over your head is more effective."
"It is not covering 100% of my eyes, just 70-80%.It is not a universal one."
Actually not a great design for a sleep mask. The donut pads that cover your eyes do a great job blocking light but the overall strap of the mask is poorly designed: it gets stretched out easily and always slips down my face at night
"Excellent at blocking light, but uncomfortable for me, especially as a side sleeper.  Very bulky and stiff around the eyes.  Might be ok for a back sleeper."
This was very soft but put too much pressure on the area around my eyes and even my temple if I wanted to sleep on my side. Would not recommend for a side sleeper.
"Very light-tight, but easily falls off the face at night and what I really need it for is blocking light in the morning. If you tighten enough to keep snug, it's uncomfortable enough to keep you from sleeping."
The back strap is too thick and is uncomfortable.  You feel this large indent on the back of your head while you sleep.Sleeping on your side is not great either.  The eye cups get pushed out of position easily.
I got this to protect my eyelash extensions and for total blackout. It worked well for those things but the eye cushions are so huge its extremely uncomfortable for side sleeping. After much struggle I never ended up using it.
"They don't block light any better than the $10 deep cup masks here on Amazon and honestly I don't even find these to be as comfortable as they are. The cups are a little too small diameter wise and *so* deep that they kinda collapse into the corner of your nose/eye, super awkward. No matter how I adjust them I just can't seem to make them work for me. Definitely not comfy for this side sleeper."
"Good, but not $40 good. Comfortable and blocks 100% of light once adjusted right, but overall quality doesnt match the price (maybe $25 or $30 max)"
"This mask is a mixed bag for me. When I first tried it on, I was blown away by the complete blackout these provided. Yes, these are 100% blackout!Unfortunately, I had not tried them in the real world yet. The minute I laid down on my side ( I'm a side sleeper), it was game over. They felt bulky, and wanted to shift. In order for them to remain in one spot, you had to adjust the strap pressure very tightly, but this just added to the resistance of them wanting to moved. Depending on how soft your pillows are, might determine if these can be used for ""some"" side sleeper (your mileage may vary). I have temperPedic pillows, so this definitely did not work.For those who frequently fly, and those who sleep on there back, this might be perfectly fine, but side sleepers, look elsewhere."
Maybe it's bc I have a small face but I had trouble getting it to Block all light and be comfortable enough to sleep in.
"There are several reviews on here that sums this product up well- good, not great. Definitely not the end all be all their advertisements claim it to be.First, as others have said, 100% isn't really true. While the eye cups are intuitive, any wiggle of the face or movement on the pillow breaks the seal and let's just as much light as any other sleep mask.2nd, again as others have stated, while this mask doesn't push on the eyes, it does push on the sinuses, bones, etc around the eyes. And since the eye cups are thicker than a normal eye mask, it exasperates both issues as a side and stomach sleeper.So while not a bad sleep mask, per say, their corny, infomercial like advertisements are peddling just another overblown product."
"I work overnights and sleep during the day.  In my opinion, this brand has hands down the best sleep masks for keeping light out.  I have the weighted mask, and it is my absolute favorite except for the strap that goes around the back of my head; it's rather clunky and I can feel the ""bulge"" of the strap when I lay on my back and can be rather uncomfortable sometimes.  I figured I'd try this slim style to see if it would help... and it does!  The issue is that the mask as a whole is so lightweight that it constantly slips off my head - I tend to toss and turn.  I feel that if the weighted mask came with the slim headband, it would be a home run - and I mean a friggin' grand slam.  But until then, back to the weighted one for now... I'd rather take the time to find the comfortable spot with the clunky headband than have the mask fall off and wake me up multiple times.  Sigh."
"This one is just not good, and I'm sorry to say it because I REALLY wanted to love this.I am an RN with a history of a weird sleeping schedule. I bought this based on the good reviews on their website and amazon prime's free shipping. I had also seen an ad for them on Facebook. They have great marketing! The first night I loved it. (I think i was just not used to wearing a face mask and itwas just better than nothing)All other nights were down hill from there.My biggest complaint is how hot this mask is. I am NOT a sweaty female AT ALL. Like literally borderline freezing all of the time. But my face and eyes would literally sweat underneath this mask, and i would wake up horribly itchy and uncomfortable. I looked on their website and you can buy their cooling pads... for an additional $20-30 of course.No thank you?Another thing to know is their pads are Velcro so if you keep adjusting them By pulling them off repeatedly eventually you'll ruin the Velcro. And honestly you have to adjust the eye pads differently for every sleep position because the cups can let out just a bit of light if you don't!I tried making it tighter to keep the light out but then I ended up getting a headache from it."
"Worse than a cheaper MZOO blindfold. No better at blacking everything out, but more bulky and awkward to wear."
i shift around at night and the mask has a tendency to slip off of my face
Really wanted to like this item but the strap in the back creates a bump which is uncomfortable for me (as a back sleeper). Wish there was a little more fabric so that people could fasten on the side. It's very soft and otherwise comfortable but I will need to return it as I found myself ripping it off in the middle of the night
"I had high hopes for this mask, but it does not live up to the hype.I am primarily a side sleeper, take a long time to wind down, and am prone to overheating, so I end up flipping back and forth between my side and back and adjusting the covers a lot when trying to fall asleep. That doesn't bode well for anything  on my head, whether it be a scrunchie, a hat in colder weather, or a sleep mask.This mask, in spite of its hype, has been a completely disappointing waste of money and time spent trying to make it work for me.First off, it's unbelievably difficult to adjust the eye cups to the right positions. You just have to guess and keep guessing. You have to have the mask off of your face to move the eye cups. I tried about 30 different times to get the eye cups in the right places and at the right angles under the mask. I finally found one position that sort of works, but......secondly, there's a ton of light leakage, even if the cups are pretty much in the right place! Just like other reviewers have said, the only way to have no light (especially around the bridge of the nose) is to strap the mask on so tightly that it causes undue pressure around the eyes, bordering on creating a headache. The only other option is to have an already-darkened room — in which case, why would you need a sleep mask? If, like me, you move around a lot when you sleep, the thing's going to shift right off your head, too, no matter what, which is disruptive.Adjusting the strap to fit your head is also a nightmare. It's either going to be too tight or too loose almost any way you try to make it fit. There are small pieces of elastic toward the back, but they are stiff enough that don't help. If I place the strap so it doesn't smoosh the tops of my ears, then the eye cups are almost too low for the strap to help them block light. Maybe I just have a weird eye/ear-height relationship?I thought the eye cups would be the selling feature of this mask, but they are not — they are hot. Really hot. After about ten minutes, it feels like I have put heating pads around my eyes. The cups become little dark greenhouses in which potato sprouts could flourish. There is no cooling air flow (except maybe where light leaks in). The cups are a just-hard-enough foam that they do not mold well to the actual contours of my face, and the fabric covers on them are completely non-absorbent.I've looked for the cooling eye cups, but I can't find them here on Amazon. They would probably be a gel plastic and not absorptive at all, anyway, which would offer a whole host of other problems.I imagine that if you're traveling on a train, an airplane, or as a passenger in a car and you wanted to cut yourself off from some (but not all) light and noise, you could use these with some noise canceling headphones and get by. For actual sleep, restorative sleep, sleep that gets you through the night, this mask doesn't do it for me.Very occasionally I can get in about a half hour of napping during the day with minimal discomfort before some problem with the mask wakes me up again. Sometimes, a half hour nap is all I need to return to my day. So, that is the only thing I can use this mask for now. I can't rely upon it at night for any help. It's way too uncomfortable and difficult to manage, to the point of repeated disruption.I would do better with a plain bandanna tied around my eyes, honestly."
"I like the attempt. The materials are superb. Incredibly soft and amazing feeling to the touch. However, the execution is lacking. By design, this product is essentially like wearing swim googles to bed, but with pillows instead of gaskets around the eyes. The natural uncomfortable question arises, do I put the straps over the ears or behind. Both suck. Either your ears are scrapped by velcro or compressed by the band. Both making sleep hard. The second major flaw is either the band falls off your head immediately because it is too loose or the ""eyecup"" things that are the selling point put the entire gripping force around your eye sockets, once again, making sleep difficult. Thereby defeating the entire purpose of the product. Thirdly, the structural integrity of the eye socket compressing grip falls apart when you sleep on your side, once again, making them difficult to sleep in if you're a side sleeper. Overall I feel really bad giving them a bad review. It is clear that massive effort and thought was put into the design, material selection, and attempt, but overall falls massively shorter from what you can get for less than 10 dollars from generic Chinese shipper number 1,523 on this site. Definitely avoid this product, but would try a new design in a heartbeat from this company if steps are made to improve this concept!"
"I bought this mask because of its promise that it provides 100% blackout while also maintaining zero pressure on and around the eyes. The material that the mask itself is made out of is very soft and plush, especially on the interior. The material that the detachable eye-cups are made of seems to be memory foam (although I couldn't find any confirmation of this on the official store website, or anywhere). The attachable parts of the mask were made of a material akin to Velcro, except it was more discrete, and didn't tug on any loose hair.On the first few nights that I tried this mask on, I realized that the only way to truly get the ""blackout effect"" that was heavily marketed was to have the mask, and the eye-cups, placed firmly around your face. Over a couple minutes of wearing the mask, it caused mild discomfort that gradually increased throughout the night until I took it off. Initially, I brushed this off as needing the memory foam to soften to my facial structures. Within the next week and a half, I saw no difference in the discomfort that I was experiencing with this mask. The last night that I slept with the mask on, I woke up to what felt like a sinus headache. Again, it was because of the pressure that the mask placed on my sinuses. That night, I switched back to my 5 year old silk sleep mask, and got much better rest than I have got within the past week and a half with trialing this mask.Overall, I was disappointed with the results that this mask gave me (It actually worsened my sleep quality within the trial period I used it). The promise that it ostensibly provided zero pressure on the eye is borderline false advertisement. The best thing about this product was the quality material that the mask itself was made of, and the generous return policy."
"Theoretically, this mask seemed perfect after looking at the photos.  But once it arrived and I tried it for two nights,  its flaws and high price point had me send it back.  I'm happy with a less fussy and less expensive mask which I'll mention at the end of this review.The thick walls of the eyecups were not necessarily a dealbreaker for me as a side sleeper.  They WERE uncomfortable on whichever side of the face was against the pillow, but that may not be a problem for you, even if you're a side sleeper, depending on how soft or firm your pillow is.  What is irritating is that when I came to write this review, I noticed that the product page claims THIS product is perfect for side sleepers—but then I also saw they peddle a ""slim"" version that is specifically targeted for side sleepers.The adjustable eyecups were a big selling point for me.  I thought they made sense, allowing for a customized fit.  But in reality, once you pull them off of the mask base, trying to achieve symmetry or gauge whether you're putting them back in the same place makes them more of a liability than a benefit.  If the mask base had some markings on it, it would make tweaking the positioning of the eyecups so much easier.  I wasn't able to successfully adjust the eyecups to stop light from coming in near the inner edges of my eyebrows.  The only way I could achieve blackout was to make the fit tighter than was comfortable.The band itself isn't uncomfortable, but I had forgotten that it's a pain to adjust the band on masks like these (it's been a couple of years since I've worn a sleep mask) where the band is two separate straps that join by overlapping.  Similar to the eyecups, trying to guess whether you've reattached the velcro straps to make them tighter or looser is a pain.  If the straps had markings so that you could see aim at a specific level of overlap, it would be an improvement.Ultimately, I went with one of the Unimi ""2021 Upgraded"" sleep mask here on Amazon.  Unimi has several generations of masks available; I tried the third generation and it's a keeper.  No eyecups to move around, 100% blackout, and a closed-loop band that can be adjusted by sliding the plastic piece left or right with one hand make it almost perfect for me.  The cushioning is a bit thick for a side sleeper, but I don't want to try their thinner version for side sleepers because I'm afraid I won't get complete blackout.  The product page for this one is here: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QRC4C5Q or you can search for it in the Amazon searchbox with product code: B08QRC4C5Q"
"This mask is one of those things that is probably better in theory than in practice. It's designed to function well, but once you actually put it on you see why it doesn't work.It took me quite a while to get the eye cups adjusted in a way to achieve as near to ""100% blackout"" as I could. Even after about 20 minutes of adjustments I couldn't achieve 100% darkness. Light leaks in through the front of the band and then through the sides of the eye cups. It also leaks in through the bottom of the eye cups. The only way to achieve nearly 100% (but still not 100%) darkness was to tighten the mask until it was uncomfortable. I'd say this mask blocks maybe 5-10% more light than any standard sleep mask with a nose flap.The eye cups are intended to take pressure off of your eyes, but I don't find that a regular mask applies an uncomfortable amount of pressure to my eyes to begin with. They advertise the cups allowing you to blink, but who is blinking when they're sleeping? My eyes are staying closed.The problem with the cups is that they don't eliminate the pressure, they just shift it to the area around your eye. With the mask on tight enough, so it stays put and doesn't leak any light, you've now got two giant cups around your eyes pressing down on the area around them. It gets even worse if you're a side sleeper; you're not going to avoid partially resting your head on one of the cups against the pillow and that's when the mask really starts to become unusable. It's like you're sleeping on a knot in a rope pressed up against your cheek and eye socket. Totally uncomfortable.All of these downsides and discomfort from wearing the mask makes the marginal increase in darkness compared to a regular mask not worth it. Any light leaking in is annoying, and slightly less light leaking in, while also having an uncomfortable mask on, is not better.I forced myself to use the mask for a few nights to see if it just took a bit to get used to, but after a few nights I always found myself reaching for my existing, cheap (way cheaper than this one), normal sleep mask over the Manta every time. There's nothing about this mask that works for me. Maybe it'll work for you if you've never used a regular mask and have nothing to compare it to, and sleep on your back, but other than that, just stick with the $5 one you already have.This mask seems like it's made well, and the fabric is a nice material. I wouldn't mind seeing this company attempt to make a standard mask with this quality (and at a more reasonable price), but this concept for a mask is a bust.Hopefully the ""100%"" in their ""100% Satisfaction"" claim is closer to 100% than the ""100%"" in their ""100% Blackout"" claim."
"So I bought this at the end of 2022. Its a great sleep mask for what it is, but as a side sleeper it would put a little pressure on my right eye. I got used to it and didn't think much of it, until I went in for my annual eye exam, and found that I had signifgantly worse vision in my left eye. I am fairly healthy and in my mid 20s -- I have never had less than 20/20 vision. My doctor was puzzled as to the source of this issue, until I mentioned the sleep maskApparently sleeping with an eye mask like this can put pressure on your eyes(sort of like the way pressing on them will cause blurriness for a few minutes), causing the vision lose. I now need glassses. My doc suspects that without the mask my vision should return to normal in a few months.Writing this to let people know about this issue. Not worth damaging your eye site"
I wanted to love it. It feels like such high quality... but it's not comfortable at all. I tried several different kinds and was sure this would be the best. It's just too tight. I could maybe take a 15 minute nap.. but I cannot wear it to bed. Went with a cheaper softer option that did about as well at blocking light.
"I am an adult woman with a small-ish/average-ish face. This sleep mask does not work for me at all. It does not block light (for how my face is) unless I strap it extremely tight to my face (not comfortable) no matter how I position the eye pads - i've tried wide, narrow, even flipping them 90 degrees. I've tried just dealing with that it lets light in and to still sleep with this mask on, but I am a side sleeper and the pads are not angled in a way that works to sleep on your side. They get pushed by your pillow and the mask either will fall off if it's loose on your head (comfortable) or the eye pads will put a lot of pressure on your temple if it's tightly secured. I find the foam of the eye pads too stiff and uncomfortable - there is pressure on the bridge of my nose (again, no matter how I position it) and on my temples if I try to sleep on my side. I like the idea of adjustability of this mask and that it allows room to blink. It just does not work for me. I am now looking for a mask with softer more giving and conforming foam (more memory foam or gel-like) and a bit of an angle on the outer edges by the temples so I can sleep on my side. I still want space for blinking and adjustability if possible. The search goes on."
"I've known about this brand for awhile but always avoided purchasing a sleep mask from them due to the high price. I ended up ordering this mask because I was in desperate need of a sleep mask and I figured why the heck not. Well, let me tell you why the heck not- it's super uncomfortable. The eye cups seem like they are soft enough to accomodate a side-sleeper but the reality is that after wearing this mask for even a few hours you will have a headache (unless you sleep exclusively on your back). For me, this was a huge waste of money."
"I'm a back sleeper so comfort wise this mask was not a problem at all and it did indeed block 100% of ambient light. My biggest issue with the mask is the overall quality. Despite claiming to use high quality materials, after only a few months both the velcro and elastic have worn out considerably. The elastic bands on both sides of the mask are all crinkled up and you see bits and pieces of elastic sticking out. Also, the velcro barely sticks anymore, it seems as if the material its supposed to stick to has worn out and is all fuzzy now so the velcro can't get a good grip on it. It barely sticks now and often when I'm first settling into bed it comes loose and I have to re-attach. This is all despite following the exact instructions for washing and having a skinny head, so it's not like any of these components are under considerable stress. For this price point, I expected a lot better."
"These aren't comfortable if you sleep on your side or belly. The pads under the eyes keep the light out, but they're a little stiff and push into your face, causing pain and pressure."
This mask is the best on the market. This is my second time purchasing Manta and I would've given it 5 stars but considering my last mask came with a carry pouch for storing it and this time it didn't I had to deduct a star.
"I found these extremely comfortable to sleep with and then I looked into the mirror in the morning and fainted. Just short of black eyes! The eye pieces try to fit well--and I am sure if you are a back sleeper they will be just perfect. However, it you sleep on your side, or God forbid, on your stomach, you are not able to show your face for a couple of hours after waking."
"I am kind of on the fence about this sleep mask after a couple months of use. It is definitely bulky for side-sleeping, but it is otherwise very comfortable and a good quality. It does keep the light out for the most part unless I am laying on it at a weird angle."
I wish this would have stayed on my face but it always slides off. It was soft and comfortable and didn't put pressure on my eyes. But I must pull it off when I sleep or move too much or something. It didn't help unfortunately. And it doesn't fit well with a CPAP mask.
"This mask is high quality, and blocks out 100% of light. It's adjustable and super soft. However, as a side-sleeper, the the weight of your head seems to create a pressure point on outside of your eye socket, cause by the eye ""cups"". This gets pretty uncomfortable after a while. This mask is the best light-blocking mask I've experienced, at the cost of side sleeping."
"I found this product to be a little over-hyped. Take it for what it is - a sleeping mask. It is not some magic remedy for poor sleep. It's for keeping light out, nothing more. If you struggle to fall asleep due to sound or your mind not switching off, this won't fix that.However, they are extremely comfortable and once you find the right fit, they completely block out ALL light. So if you are buying it for that reason alone, there is no better option."
"Seems like a perfectly fine sleep mask, plenty of room in the eye cups to keep pressure off your eyes and when fit snugly blocks out all light.  Had never used a sleep mask before and find this one to be uncomfortable for me as a side sleeper."
"Puts pressure on my sinuses. Had to adjust eye cups slightly.  I sew and am crafty, so easy for me to do. I'm used to it.  I have to adjust anything I  wear.Very soft, stays put.Best thing is,  usually my ears hurt because I'm a side sleeper. Wakes me up. The straps are cushy though and protects my ears"
"the mask is great and comfortable even as a side sleeper, but sadly is not 100% blackout unless you tight to the back of your head unconfortably tight, but even if its not 100% blackout is still quite comfortable and block light enough to make it useful."
"I personally found this sleep mask to be like wearing a swim mask. It felt intrusive to me but DID keep all light out once adjusted. The fabric is like a tee shirt material which helps keep it from slipping I guess but I found it to be hot. I prefer a slick fabric as it seems to be cooler for me. The velcro type material on the strap is awesome and no way will it stick to your hair or anything else, which is a plus. Everyone is different and these are as stated and just not for me but it doesn't mean you won't like it. I will return these and try another kind."
I really like this sleep mask. It's totally dark when I put them on! Very comfortable although it did take time to get used to it. The sides are a little too thick and I have to wear them over my ears instead of over the top of them. Laying on my side with them wasn't comfortable at first but I'm used to it now. My favorite sleep mask I've ever had!
"Compared to the original Manta sleep mask, this ""minimalist"" version is marketed as being easier on the ears, which is true in one way but untrue in another. It is true that its band doesn't go around the ears, so it doesn't cause pressing pain of the ears like the original. However, its thin band, which is designed to sit above the ears, has a pretty abrasive edge and cuts into the crook of the ear. Trading one discomfort for another."
"This product blocks the light and helps me sleep. I have washed it several times and it holds up nicely, the velcro doesn't get caught in my curly hair. The only downside for me is that the eye cups are a bit bulky and until you wear them in, side on tummy sleeping will be awkward."
"The first night was a hard one for me using it. The second night was less so, and by the fourth night, I was able to sleep fine without it. My only complaint is that it gets a little too hot around my eyes. Other than that, I would put my face directly into something with it on and feel some pressure while I wore it."
"While i will say its comfortable, it has not improved my sleep.  It does stick off the face too much to wear every day (im a nurse who works nights and sleeps days).  I was hoping to be able to put these on and be able to rest comfortably, however you notice you have these on.  Blackout curtains for me."
"Great for sleeping on your back, top notch. Tough with a mask on (i.e. Covid airplanes). Also not great for sleeping on your side. Tends to fall off in the night if it's too loose and hurt if it's too tight. Overall, I love it as I've learned to sleep on my back, but I still use my cheaper regular sleep mask for planes and side sleeping."
The title explains how I feel. This sleep mask is nearly perfect except for one complain I have. The back on the mask where the straps connect via Velcro causes a little bit of discomfort when I'm laying on my back to sleep. Nothing terrible but I definitely notice it.
What a great design. the pockets really block out all the sunlight. The whole item is very comfortable on your face. The straps are very soft too and doesn't fall off during the sleep like the others ive bought. I definitely recommend this product %100!
First few nights I didn't like how it fit. Kept having to adjust it and couldn't get it right. I was about to return it actually.After washing it for the first time I got it right finally and now I do really love it.
"The mask does work well for blocking out light. Love the movable eye pieces to get a personalized fit. The eye cushions are a little uncomfortable if you are a side sleeper because they can cause pressure points depending on how you lay on them. However, it's the best mask I've found so far."
"The best eye mask for cpap users is EyeEco, but it looks goofy.  It took about 2 weeks to break this in and find the right position with my cpap. The eye pads and my mask still bump into each other at times, but it works. This is probably best for people with taller faces so the mask doesn't hit the cpap."
If your a side sleeper. I would recommend getting the slim version of this. Even though this says it's good for side sleepers. It is very comfortable.
I got these to block out light from my window and it's pitch black in these things. I can fully open my eyes as still see nothing. Not the best for side sleeping because it can press the eye a little bit but once you find that sweet spot good sleep is imminent.
"I got the eye mask because I am a side sleeper and wear false lashes. The mask is deep enough so that it doesn't touch my lashes. For the most part, it keeps my lashes intact when I sleep except if I move the mask in my sleep."
The mask is great and definitely keeps the light out. The down side is I'm a back sleeper and the Velcro strap in the back is annoying as your head rests on that part of the strap. It would be great if the back of the strap was wider to displace the impact of the Velcro bump.
This definitely blocks out all light but I think it would be better if you were on a bus or plane and wanted to catch a nap. The pads are so thick and stiff that it makes any sort of side sleeping impossible.
"Not the most comfortable mask I've found for side sleepers, but overall best I've tried so far. The adjustable cups make it easy to fit the mask to any face, and it blocks out light like a champ. Only downaide is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting to get them comfortable when sleeping on your side. They stay on your head better than most masks as well. Would recommend."
"Similar to one I have which was no longer available, I gave this to my son in law as a gift. Uses it, loves it, never knew what he had been missing out on. Came fast and in perfect condition."
"The eye pillows are wonderful love that I can position them, perfect for someone wearing a full face CPAP mask.  However the elastic band that goes around the back is a little too narrow causing the strap to start rolling over on itself as it's being used.  I assume because I have a big head and that I can't loosen it any more without the velcro not holding."
"So far I've really loved this product. My experience has been that at least when sleeping on my side, I can't usually get 100% blackout without a /lot/ of adjusting. That said, I don't need 100%, I just need something to block out most of the light, and having a physical item that makes me sleep and keeps me from checking my phone every 4 minutes. Very comfy, doesn't make me overheat, doesn't get tangled or anything. I am thinking of trying out the weighted band soon, as I sleep with a weighted blanket and the concept of something similar in a sleep mask to me is super duper appealing. Overall, I think this mask has worked great for me. But as some of the other reviews have said, esp for side sleepers it falls a little short of total blackout without a lot of adjustment. Keep that in mind of its something that would be a big problem before buying."
"I like this mask a lot, and usually wear it as I'm falling to sleep. But if I rollover to my side, the cups dig in a bit too much. The eye cups do a great job of giving total blackout. If you're someone who enjoys staring into TOTAL darkness to rest your eyes, this is great even if it winds up coming off during the night.I just wish the eye cups were about half the thickness, or a little cushier. They're like a memory foam material which is good for stability and keeping bits of light out, but there's a comfort tradeoff unless you're a back-only sleeper."
"I should have bought it straight from Manta. This one seems to be a knock off because the Velcro is not very strong and the outer covering is not quite large enough to cover the eye cups. It still gives complete blackout and is comfortable. I owned a real one from Manta before and loved it, but sadly left it in a hotel room. I ordered this one as a replacement and it will do, but just isn't quite as high quality as what I had before."
It is comfortable  but the stick is little bit loosen after 6 months
When I first tried these I didn't like them at all. As a side sleeper I found that one of the eye cups just dug into the side of my face and pushed the whole contraption out of whack. However... since the eye cups are held in place with Velcro - to accommodate adjusting them - I just removed the cup on one side and blam! these babies worked great. The fit then was pretty darn good and they didn't get all skewed on my face. I still think the price is a little high but anything that'll get me a few more hrs or even minutes of sleep I'd pay just about anything for.
Tried so many different eye masks for cpap user. This one is the best to block out the air from the machine. Highly recommend for that purpose and comfort.
"I've used sleep masks for at least 20 years as I used to work overnight. I have tried every type of sleep mask on the market, and I was a bit skeptical of this one. It is the most comfortable mask I have ever had, and it provides the best eye coverage I have ever seen (or not seen, I suppose). The ONLY drawback to the mask is that after months of having it I have had to tighten it a couple of times as it does stretch out from use and the straps will fall down the back of my head. Even with that I still get a seal over my eyes and it does not wake me up from any discomfort."
"The mask is very soft and comfortable, and after adjusting the eye cups (they velcro on) it's hard to notice it's on!…that's what my review would be if I was a back sleeper, at least.I love the mask, and it is actually very comfortable, but I find myself adjusting and fiddling with it when lying on my side. The pillow likes to push against the eye cup which can either cause light to seep in or just be uncomfortable.I like the mask and don't think I'll return it, but be aware if you're a side sleeper that it can be uncomfortable. That being said, I think this would be perfect for travel or for back sleepers."
"I have bought SO MANY different eye masks trying to get one that fits well and blocks out all light while I'm wearing my CPAP. None have worked all that well until this one.I use this over top of my CPAP straps because the eye pads are thick enough to allow it, and being able to position the eye cups wherever they work best is a godsend.The only thing I don't like about this mask is how expensive it is, but I guess I'll see how long it lasts before needing replacing to decide if the $35 price tag is reasonable. I feel like it was a necessary purchase though, even if I don't like the price."
"I like the adjustability of the eye cups. I do not like the fact that after more than a month the chemical odor stings my nostrils and my eyes, so I have not been able to use this for more than a few minutes, and definitely not for a full sleep cycle."
I really love this product but I cannot get it to stay on my face all night. My eye gets smushed by it and then I have blurry vision out of one eye the next day .
The fit was awkward. I put too much effort in to make it just right only to roll over and have to adjust it again. Maybe I would have a better experience if I just stuck it out but once I found my usual one I let it go.
"If you need a sleep mask to sleep, I could recommend these, but apparently I just wanted to waste 30 bucks to try them out. They are super comfy, but I sleep better not wearing them. My pair will be completely relegated to travel use."
Had the original version and loved it - this one not so much. The foam seems to be bigger and firmer. As a side sleeper this digs in to my face where the original Manta did not.
"5 star idea, 2 star execution. I saw lots of targeted ads for this and it looked like a really good idea, but the product isn't made very well at all and the material is rough and uncomfortable. The Velcro eyes are hard to position right and it's just not conformable, it just seems not made well. It's pretty expensive and I wish it was better."
"While side sleeping, the eye well rims actually push against your eye and face, making it very uncomfortable. For back sleepers this may work just fine."
"It's a quality product and if I slept on my back it would be my favorite sleep mask, but I don't. When I'm on my side and my face is in my pillow it slips enough to no longer fit properly (and sometimes significantly). I tried adjusting the strap but the only way for me to prevent this was to make it too tight. It's a shame because I really wanted to love this mask, and it's not cheap! I'm back to using one that cost $7."
"I like this product especially for it's comfort as long as I'm sleeping on my back.  It's not as comfortable when I sleep on my side.  The eye pads are thick and comfy; but, they are a little too bulky when on my side."
Mask shifts if you're a side sleeper. Needs to cover more of eye socket.
Not total blackout unless you tighten it more than others. A bit bulky.
"This mask really does work as intended and 100% blocks out light, so let me preface this review by saying that it does what it's supposed to. To anyone who sleeps only on their back and doesn't shift throughout the night, you may actually have a good experience with this mask.However, as I'm a side sleeper, I found it impossible to sleep on my side while wearing because the cups surrounding each eye are so firm that they dig and compress into my eye sockets. The eye cups are removable and are attached to the mask with velcro so they can be adjusted, but unfortunately the padding on the outsides of each is just too bulky with my head pressed into a pillow. Would have been much better had they tapered the cups so the outsides have less padding. Bummed I have to return this."
Interesting design that might work better with good quality memory foam rather than stiff cheap feeling foam.  Using stiff foam makes it so you need to tighten the mask too tight in order to get decent light blocking.  It also falls off easily and feels bulky.
"Ingenious sleep mask that is adjustable and really blocks out all the light. BUT...only good if you lie on your back all night. As soon as you turn onto your side, the large foam rubber circles put sharp pressure just to the side of your eye. Very few people will be able to tolerate that--certainly not me. Dishonest to advertise this as good for side sleeping--it's awful for it. But this is great if you sleep only on your back."
"Great concept. Mostly very good product ... except for that all important part where it's supposed to completely blackout light. Apparently not all faces are the same. Spent three nights trying different methods, but the only way I could achieve total darkness with this sleep mask was to put it on so tightly that it clogged my sinuses. A shame, that, because in almost every respect this is a stellar idea. The eye cups are soft, roomy and moveable (velcro). Likewise, the band itself is smartly designed so the velcro part doesn't ever touch the hair, and the fabric is soft and 'gentle' all around. Design looks neat too. Just ... doesn't function well enough compared to sleep masks half the price."
"Wanted to like this product because of the ads I've seen but it turned out to be a dud. The eye sockets protrude far too high off of your face making it a horrible experience for side sleepers and their necks. The mask also rides up when you sleep so was woken by daylight not the complete blackout experience I was expecting. The only good part about this was the adjustable strap. Don't waste your money on this. I found an $8 one that is far better with memory foam, space to open your eyes without them rubbing and complete blackout capabilities.The transaction itself was smooth. Product did not meet expectations."
"I see manta mask ads all over facebook so I thought I would finally cave and give them a try. When you put them on, unless you align them absolutely perfectly (and I only managed to partially do this once), they tend to let light in on the side. The fabric didn't feel very high quality. The mask itself wasn't very wide but the eyepieces kind of velcro in so if you have small eyes they may fit you better. I rolled over and put more of my face on the pillow in my sleep and the pressure of this mask on my face in the morning was very very uncomfortable. I would not order this again, and because I threw the packaging away gave it to my husband, who can't roll over with a cpap mask on so he's okay with using the mask."
Not as comfy as reviews would make it seem. Terrible as a side sleeper for me
"These are too stiff around my head and not wearable overnight.  I had a pair from ""air grip"" pillow that I loved and lost.  I replaced them with these.  Very disappointing.  The straps are firm and thick and put too much pressure on my head while I sleep.  I do have a very sensitive skull due to a head injury.  I preferred the one from air grip pillow, as the eye pads were softer and the clasp was less bulky on the back of my head."
"I work graveyards and need to sleep during the day.  I use sleep masks to keep out the light so I can sleep.  This mask is the worst I have tried.  I always wake up to find the mask has come off in my sleep.  Never had that problem with other masks I have used.  If you are a side sleeper, it is really uncomfortable to have the foam eye cups pushed into your head.  They stick out way too far.  The concept of the moveable eye cups is nice, but they over complicated the design and made it uncomfortable to sleep with."
"I had high hopes for this mask but learned that the adjustable/moveable eye cups are just too big for my face. More light got in them a traditional face mask no matter how I adjusted it. I think I'd need eye cups about half the size to work with my face or even a material that molds better to your face.This product did work well for my husband. He has a much larger face than me so it does work, just not for me."
"Update: they updated the pictures to reflect the features of the Manta Slim.Purchased the Manta sleep mask that was ""multicolored"" since it was the one that shipped using Amazon Prime. When I received it, I noticed that the strap that goes around your head needed to go into a loop and velcro onto itself, kinda like all cinching  straps. All pictures of the Manta do NOT have this feature. All pictures of the Manta have two straps that velcro together behind your head.When I saw this, I thought I received a fake item. After doing some research, I found out Manta also makes a ""Manta Slim"" which is exactly what this ""multicolor"" product is. Strange that this ""slim"" version is not on Manta's website through normal browsing, but is there when you do a Google search.Just a heads up that if you buy the multicolored version of this product on Amazon, you are getting the Manta Slim."
"It does a great job of keeping light out with the comfortable eye pillows , I only wish that the strap in the back wasn't so dense and long. There's no need to have a strap that long, nobody has a head that big. So lining up the strap to the velcro is cumbersome. It would be nice if the strap was wider so the fabric was dispersed more evenly against the back of my head,so it didn't put all of the pressure in just one spot, if that makes sense. If you made those changes I definitely change my rating score."
"These things work pretty well, but are not as perfect as advertised.  They're certainly an innovative design and seem very well made with soft fabrics that are pleasing to the touch and (my favorite part) washable.  They don't retain heat or cause sweating, which is excellent, and unlike flat sleep masks they don't rest on your eyes.  With a regular sleep mask, the pressure on my eyes would cause me to wake with extremely blurred vision that would take a while to clear up...  Reading anything right after waking was a near impossibility.  With this thing, there's no pressure on the eyelids, so I wake up with perfectly refreshed eyes.  To achieve this, they've created what are essentially 1"" thick foam donuts around your eyes, and while the thickness is what makes them work so well, it's also their biggest flaw, as any sleeping position that isn't flat on your back becomes problematic.  Side-sleeping is tricky because, generally speaking, when you're on your side, one whole side of your face is being pressed into the pillow.  Normally, that's not an issue, but with these things on you have a 1"" thick foam donut to contend with, and under pressure, that donut becomes a bagel.  Sure it's a nice, soft fabric and a pliable foam, but that doesn't really matter when it's being pressed into your eye socket.  It adds a lot of pressure to your face, which can be distracting and disrupt sleep.  Furthermore the strap on the Slim model tends to rest right above the ears, which can rub and become irritating, particularly on the adjustable side of the strap, which is thicker and had more edging.Next, they claim 100% light blockage and while this is *almost* true, I couldn't find a fit that didn't create a small gap and let some light in at the nose/brow area, leaking light in through the space between the ""donuts.""  I found that the only way to eliminate the light was to either tighten the strap to an uncomfortable level or fill the gap between the donuts -a cotton ball might do the trick.  Now, it's a tiny amount of light -certainly not enough to bother me- but it's not 100% blackout.  It's more like, 98%.  And that's before you roll over, pressing the donut into your eye-socket and shifting the whole thing to the side.And finally, I have found that while the mask doesn't put pressure on the eyes, it does put pressure on the eye-sockets and brows.  I woke yesterday to find that my face was a little sore around the eyes, particularly where lying on my side had pressed the donuts into my eye-sockets.  Now, it went away pretty quickly, but still.Overall, they're not terrible...  They do the job well enough and I think I'd still choose them over a traditional flat mask, but they're just not the miraculous perfection that claim them to be.  If you choose to try them, be prepared for an adjustment period.  The thickness of them does make them difficult for side-sleepers to deal with but I think once you get used to them, they're pretty awesome.  And if you sleep on your back, they're really pretty fantastic."
"People rave about this mask so I bought it to try and use when I work night shift, but I couldn't stand it and ended up throwing a pillow over my face until I got a different mask. For me the main problem are the eye cups; they may not put pressure on your eyes, but the edges of the cups still put pressure on your face because of how big they are. I'm also a side sleeper and the size of the eye cups made it so that this practically came off my face when lying on my side. To me it was just a clunky design that let light in and made my face uncomfortable. I understand they've made a newer model, so maybe that one is an improvement, but I definitely won't be coming back to this version."
"Not for side sleepers, uncomfortable pressure."
This blackout blindfold was a bit uncomfortable. And no it didn't do well for my narrow face despite claims that it would. It's expensive. I am still on the hunt for a sleep mask that doesn't permit ambient light from the sides while being a comfortable fit.
"I bought this mask in hopes it would hold its shape longer than the contoured masks I usually buy, as I'm sick of having to buy new sleep masks every few months because the old ones lost their shape.  I've only used it once so far so I can't say how well it'll hold up after a few months, but the design does seem more durable than the usual contoured mask design.Problem is that the eye pieces press into my face uncomfortably when I lay on my side, as the mask gets smushed between my face and the pillow.  For back sleepers I expect this wouldn't be a problem.The other issue is that, at least with my face shape, it doesn't completely block out all the light; it blocks MOST of it if I play around with the straps to get adjusted properly.  Still, if the shape holds up for more than a few months and so it continues to block the same amount of light, I'll be satisfied -- the reason I'm always having to replace my sleep masks is because once they start losing their shape, their ability to block out light is severely hampered."
"Let me preface this review by sharing that I wear an eye mask to bed every single night so the sun doesn't wake me up in the morning. I have found masks that work for me over the years only to have the manufacturer stop selling them. So, I am always on the hunt for true blackout sleep masks.This eye mask is such a great idea. By moving the eye pads around, you can get them to be full blackout, which I was super excited about. Then came bedtime. I am a side sleeper and these are TERRIBLE for side sleeping. It doesn't look like it from the pictures, but is you use a pillow at all, the eye cups hit your pillow and it's so uncomfortable it almost hurts.If you sleep on your back or will only use this for travel, you will be happy with this mask. It is true blackout and it's very small and light. It is really well made. If you are a side or stomach sleeper, keep looking."
"These are exactly what I needed, total black out of light and more room for my eyes to open & close underneath. However, they are so thick, and customizable, that you move them so they don't cut into your nose and then they are so out wide on your face that when you sleep on your side the eye piece pushes hard into the side of your face around your eyes. It's truly painful by middle of the night. The light blocking is amazing though."
The band hurt my ears
"This is only for back sleepers. Impossible to wear for side or stomach sleepers, gets incredibly uncomfortable. Otherwise, works as advertised. Complete blackout."
"The Mask is innovative, but very flimsy. It is terribly overpriced at $ 35.  I returned the product to Amazon ."
"Works fine if you only sleep on your back. If you are a side sleeper it's pretty useless. It shifts too much and lets light in when you rollover. I kept waking up to adjust it, even tried moving the eye pieces/pillows but to no avail. 2 nights, same result. I had to return it."
I don't have an huge eye or head but this eye mask holes are too small and let light into them.  I am questioning all of the good reviews and wondering if they are real.
"* The cups are huge and not suitable at all if you even slightly want to sleep on your side. The cups also don't significantly block out more light than a regular contoured sleep mask.* If you sleep on your stomach, the Alaska Bear sleep mask works great. Your eyelashes will connect with the sleep mask, but it doesn't affect your sleep much and that might happen with a contoured mask on a pillow anyway.* If you sleep on your back or on your side, get a good contoured mask.* Not everyone can get great blackout curtains or maybe don't want them because they don't look great. Good blinds and a good sleep mask work well enough."
"just wasn't very comfortable, and having to find the right fit yourself was strange to me"
"I like the concept and quality of the product, but the eye cushions never fit correctly over my eyes, so light always makes its way through. Additionally, they pushes on nerves around my brow causing discomfort even when loose and pain when tight.  Side sleeping is a no-go as it bulges out an inch and will push into your socket around your eye."
"If you have to use a CPAP with the mask that covers both mouth and nose, the eye mask ends up sitting on top of the clear gasket that seals in the air. That means you're not blocking that light.If you have one of the smaller CPAP nose pieces that doesn't cover the bridge of your nose, you should be ok."
It is definitely very soft but I wouldn't say it is the most comfortable. The straps at the back can feel weird which causes difficulties to fall asleep
"This thing is really only good if you sleep on your back. I'm a side sleeper and when I turned on my side on the pillow, the side of one eye cup or the other was always pressing into the outside edge of my eye - it's somewhat soft material, but it still creates a pressure point of sorts that I would definitely classify as uncomfortable."
"It's too late to return the mask, but I wake up with blurred vision from it pushing next to my eyes. If I loosen it, it slips and I see light. It is very adjustable, which I like, but it's hard to get the eye pieces in the correct place without extra hands"
"There's some funny adjustment going on , or I guess we have to chop this up as -everybody's different . . ."
"I dislike the mask because it is heavy, hot and very uncomfortable.  I had a cyst on my brain stem and when they removed  it I had some complications and my right eye will not close.  I have to sleep with my eye covered or it will dry out."
"The bands on the side are very thick which makes sleeping on your side a bit uncomfortable. About the only thing I did like was that there was no eye pressure and did not mess with my eye lashes. This would be better suited for those that sleep on their back or in a seated position, in my opinion."
"This is great for eyelash extensions, eye pocket is nice and deep, allowing me to sleep on my side. It does make me have slightly puffier eye bags in the morning, so if I do have an earlier appointment, I have to forgo the mask and sleep on my back only."
"I love love looove sleep masks, ear plugs, and weighted blankets for sleep, and Manta looked like the holy grail for the first of those.Does it cancel the light? Yes. The eye cups being fully removable and customized is a neat touch. For me, though, those cups are WAY too thick, disrupting my side sleep. I'd have to use the weight of my arm to get the pillow juuust right and not get pushed up or around. A cheaper mask with more shallow cups is better for me, and I'll stick with those. A lovely product that I'm sure is great for back sleepers and travelers, though!"
"I don't understand how some people say this works for side sleepers. I've tried sleeping on my side with this several times, and it's horrible.  My pillow pushes on the side of the thick cushion of the cup which moves the mask slightly and I can feel the lump from the eye cushion."
"This is a great mask if you sleep on your back or are on a plane. But if you're like me and sleep on you your side, half in a pillow, there is pressure around your eyes and behind your ears with the strap (just from being bulky and your ear pressing against it) But it definitely blocks out all light! I just wish it didn't create pressure points around my eyes and behind my ears when I sleep on my side."
"This is a soft and comfortable mask that pockets the eyes and is great for back sleepers. Once I turned even slightly onto my side, the eye ""pockets"" get pushed into the eyeballs and are very uncomfortable!"
"If u r not accustomed to wearing something on your face while sleeping, don't b surprised if u remove it during sleep."
"The item itself is pretty comfy but the one major downfall is it limits you to one sleeping position. The cups press into your eyes when you lay on your side or stomach ( if you wear glasses you know the feel). I figured that maybe taking the cups off the mask might help to alleviate that, but the nose bridge part is too small and it won't fit right, allowing light in."
"No matter how tight or how I position this mask, it slides off during the night. A waste of money."
"Wanted to love this, due to innovation of its design.  Alas, one size doesn't fit all, or at least does not fit eyelashes.  Also,  the mask proved unsuitable for side sleepers or stomach sleepers, incompatible with several pillows, and prone to falling off and/or waking one up during tossing/turning."
"Although the cups on your eyes are very soft and comfortable, the lack of elastic in the band lead to slipping and sliding throughout the night. You might think you've velcroed it tightly, but if you have any hair or if you move at all throughout the night, it will not stay in place. This makes it useless for most people. I bought a better one for under a third of the price ($6.99 from MIZO) - the adjustable ELASTIC strap changes everything."
"Less comfortable than a standard eye masks, fall off of my head during the night so I wake up when the light comes in, which was the whole reason I got this mask.Positions itself as a premium product at a premium price-point but doesnt deliver."
"The fabric was very rough, especially for the eye area. The band that goes around the head was thick and uncomfortable."
"I use a sleepmask every night because im very sensitive to light. I have used cheaps masks for years, and decided to give this one a shot.In order for this to cover both of my eyes, I have to wear the mask fairly tight, which makes it completely uncomfortable. After trying this out for a couple of nights, I have gone back to my old $10 mask.I would not recommend this based on my experience."
This product is very soft and blocks all light. It is not comfortable when sleeping on side. I could not fall asleep.  No issues If you can sleep on your back.
"So this mask is not good for side sleepers in my opinion. It gave me a headache with its ""bulk"" around the eyes. If I was a back sleeper I think this product would be great! When I laid on my back it kept the light out. Very soft and it seemed like it was made well and material was soft. Just to bulky around my eyes for side sleeping. So I must return it sadly."
"Very disappointed, there was a hair that was not mine attached to it when I looked at it, it was missing the mesh bag that was supposed to go with it abd the box was warped and opened on both ends. Paid 30$ and disappointed, will try to get refu d."
"worth the additional cost to get such a quality mask. I like the holes for the eyes, and as a side sleeper, I always feel that masks get pressed too hard against my face and eyes. This one fits well, as tight as one sets it, and will protect the eyes so you don't squosh them while sleeping on your side."
"I've used these every night for the past couple of months, and I like that I can adjust the eye cups. Also, the straps that go around your head don't expand which is good since I can adjust them how I want while the other brands with elastic straps tend to lose elasticity over time."
"Ok, YES — it's a bit pricier than other masks on Amazon… but believe me… you get what you pay for.I've tried many masks and this one is by far the most comfortable, blocks light perfectly, and actually stays on my face the entire night.It's extremely cushioned, so it's great for side sleeping, too.Because of the 6 hour time change, I wore this mask during the first few nights of my Europe trip to try to combat jet lag and get my sleep cycle back in rhythm — and this thing worked better than any sleeping pill I've ever taken. The sensory deprivation of the complete darkness this mask created worked WONDERS! Thanks to this mask, I got excellent sleep every night of the trip.I highly recommend this mask."
"Because of the cup design you can really tighten the mask without any eye discomfort and get a very good seal and a secure fit. I'm a night owl/late riser, and when I wake up with the mask it's so dark that I can't believe the sun has come up until I take it off.Despite the slightly higher price relative to cheaper masks, if light is something you're struggling with then the investment in your sleep is almost certainly worth an extra $15-20. This is a buy-once-quality mask, in my opinion."
"These definitely do the trick - slip them on and experience blackout darkness no matter how bright your space is. Comfortable and soft, doesn't keep me from sleeping."
"I bought four different sleep masks online and they all leaked light. Most of them had shallow eye cups so you could feel the mask touching your eyelids. Too block out all the light leaking in I had to wear them as tight as a tourniquet.  Then I saw the Manta sleep mask on Amazon and I had to give it a try! The mask arrived an in a minute I knew I had found my key to sleeping into the morning. The deep eye cups are adjustable with Velcro so you can get a perfect fit. The soft eye cups let no light in. This is the best sleep mask I have ever owned, and I cannot imagine one could be better!"
This is the best mask I have ever found! My nose has a high bridge which causes most sleep masks to let a lot of light seep on around the nose. The Manta mask has ultra deep eye cups that can be positioned in any place and angle.  They are thicker near the nose and less deep at the sides of your face which makes it comfortable for side or stomach sleeping. My sleep has never been better since getting this mask. Highly recommend!!
Love these enough to have several pairs in different versions.
I wear it every night to sleep now. It is pricey but I have long forgotten because of the benefits. Work requires my sleep schedule to be shifted a little later so I wake up with some light shining in my room. If I get woken up too early I can just don my sleep mask and fall back to sleep quicker than ever. When washing it takes a while to dry so I do it early in the day to be able to use it again at night. Its so adjustable it sometimes makes it hard to adjust perfectly but I usually just embarrass myself and hold the eye cups perfect on my face while I ask another person to wrap the wrap around my head.
"These eye shades are soft, snug fitting or loose fitting, (depending on your preference) light weight, light proof, comfortable all night long, and they stay put no matter how much you may toss and turn in your sleep. The eyecups allow you to blink without interference, but fit comfortably around your cheek and brow ridge to keep out all light. The removable eye cups are also easily adjustable to fit any eye spacing for large or small heads. I have machine washed and dried mine and it holds up beautifully in the washing machine. I would highly recommend these eye shades to anyone like myself who lives in a heavily light polluted area like Los Angeles, California where it never gets dark. Now if I can just solve the problem of cancelling out the sound of traffic and helicopters throughout the night."
"This mask is superior to all others I have tried, and there have been quite a few.  I have a very petite face, and even so this mask is very comfortable.  The adjustable eye cups are so flexible to use, that I can arrange them to block nearly all light, and so that the mask doesn't compress the bridge of my nose like so many of the others I've tried.  Also, really making this a great purchase is the mask's ability to be washed in the washing machine.  I was hesitant to buy it because of the price, but it has been a worthwhile purchase after all.  I'm sleeping much more soundly....and didn't have a true awareness of how the ambient light in my bedroom from various electronics was impacting my sleep, and then, how the morning light wasn't allowing me to compensate for sleep lost during the night.  With the mask on, I'm sleeping much more soundly, and those odd nights where I am awakened, I can sleep later in the morning to make up for it.  If you're on the fence, I'd suggest you give this mask a try. To present this fairly-  if there was anything other than the price that I would consider a slight negative, I wish the masks were designed to be more attractive- they look like athletic wear, and are kind of masculine, but still a great purchase."
"This is my second manta mask. Love the light blocking. It's a bit warm for summer and the foam cups feel firmer/less comfortable than first mask. Velcro works better now. As a side sleeper, I'd soring for the one w the shaped cups. Lots of masks out there. I think manta is worth the $."
"This eye mask blocks the light well, especially since the eye cups and band are adjustable with Velcro. However, the ""side sleeper"" band is just uncomfortable. Tight and itchy around where the ears meet the head, I have woken up with pain and irritation in that area. I will try to loosen the band but if it's too loose it will not stay in place. Might be worth it to rethink the textile material around this area, Manta, go something much softer."
"Best out of maybe four masks I've used.  The eye cups still leak light unless you get it just right and/or tighten it to the point the strap is too tight.  Also, the strap has to be in the right place to hold the mask just right, but shifting your head a time or two on the pillow pulls the mask out of whacks so....  I'd put some more r/d into the band situation."
"Hard to sleep on sides with them, but still sleeping better then otherwise since I'm sensitive to light."
"Love the product!  My husband uses it most nights, as I tend to stay up later, and the light disturbs his rest.Only complaint is as comfortable as it is, and as well as it blocks out the light and you can blink (doesn't press), is that it GETS HOT.(<<Update>>  I should clarify that we live near DC, and it's humid here for a good portion of the year.  Hot happens.)So fall asleep and stay asleep?  No problem.  Wake up in the middle of the night, yep, they are coming off, because it's hot.I've heard that this company has made other products, and has an add-on that you can use to add essential oils somewhere to help you fall asleep and relax.  As long as it stays away from your eyes, it's close enough to your nose that you could benefit from essential oils too.PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS HAS HELPED YOU by giving it a thumbs up - thanks!"
"Well, I don't love eye masks but Sometimes i need one. So as eye masks go this one is fairly comfortable, fairly light, blacks out the light and does not touch your eyes. So it is a good eye mask"
"In search of a eye mask that I could wear at night with my CPAP.  It is the most difficult thing to find.  The mask sits above my eyebrows when the mask is on, totally defeats the purpose of the purchase.  Without the mask this is a great product because it does not sit directly on the eyes allowing for the lashes to move."
"I was desperately in need of an eye mask that blocked out light, was comfortable & didn't leave me with headaches in the morning if I was even able to keep it on all night. The other masks I've tried hurt my head from the elastic strap, sat too far down on my nose & only blocked 60-70% of the light. This mask with the eye cups is genius. It keeps at a minimum 98% of the light out (on my side just a bit came through), stays off of my nose and has an adjustable soft, wide velcro strap. For my particular head, the strap does lay over the top of my ears but after a few nights, I didn't notice it. Currently ordering my second one to leave at our cabin...I forgot it once & definitely slept worse without it. I am leaving one there so that doesn't happen again. I highly recommend spending the money as it is well worth it!"
"A really great mask, I love how I can adjust the cups, and the strap. Blocks out light, if your a side sleeper you will have to put the strip on right. Which can be uncomfortable, but I figured out how to adjust it comfortably. Also, if you go on manta.com They have one for side sleepers, silk and different kinds. I wish Amazon had every kind of manta, to fit the consumer needs. Amazon only has the basic manta face mask. The only thing I didn't like was because it's cotton I wake up in the middle of the night with a lot of sweat. That's why I went on the site to get silk. Overall it's the best sleep mask I ever had. I had every brand and manta is the best thus for."
"I paid a little extra for this one, as it seemed to be more a name brand than a generic and have recently had poor luck with generic. I receive this product, and it feels horrible to the hand. It feels fine while wearing it, but the outside feels horrible, and removing the velcro to adjust the eye cups had me worried the fabric would tear before the velcro released, and it's not even particularly strong velcro. Overall it works very well as a sleep mask, but paying the extra for this brand is not worth it. Plenty of companies make the same mask for cheaper. Even if they didn't this one does not inspire confidence, and at the price it absolutely should."
"I had been using your run-of-the-mill sleep mask for a while, but didn't like a few things. First, it was not made of the most breathable material, so my face felt warm, almost sweaty. Second, it was a firm fit, and pressed against my eyelids. Figured there had to be a better option.At first blush, Manta seemed to solve my major complaints with the old mask. I could adjust the fit, and could open my eyes while still having them covered. The material felt great. But, I sleep on my side - and the cups of the Manta mask compress between the pillow and my face. It's just uncomfortable enough for me to notice and prevent me from falling asleep.So, it's back to the old flat mask, for now."
"i definitely need to upgrade to the max size eye cups as my eyelashes are too long naturally for the size that comes with the original, and mine get stuck when i blink.  since i need to sleep with a mask for chronic dry eye and nocturnal lagophthalmos closing my eyes as best as i can and keeping the mask on while i toss and turn all night is pretty important.  which also brings me to the reason why i think i may also need to get the slim version for side sleepers as well, as i do tend to sleep on my sides and have a very small head.  i houdini'd out of the original mask as-is on my first night sleeping with it."
"I sleep on my side and on my stomach. This is problematic with the mask because it puts unnatural pressure on the mask against my face, making it hard to sleep. If I could just sleep on my back, this would be a great product. Sadly, it was a waste of my money."
its back is better then other eye masks but should have a function to go around the ears instead to not have pressure on the back of the head. Unfortunately like all other eye masks I found it has a 20% opening at the nose area that lets light in making it useless and its hotter and more expensive then others. Still the back piece is better then other companies that have metal back their.
"Different than other masks. I was hopeful about this but it comes off during the night just as much and is uncomfortable in its own way. As others have said, it is very uncomfortable to sleep with this unless you're sleeping on your back. And oddly? Though the eye cups are supposed to reduce eye pressure, in some ways, I find them to create their own pressure, but in a different way.They are great at keeping all the light out, if they don't come off or slip out of place."
The placement around the eyes feels very hard like a block of something (too sturdy) surrounding your eyes so its quiet an uncomfortable feeling. A memory-foam probably give more gentle feels and so when you sleep on your side you wont have any proble squeezing it a little.Basically the structure of the mask around the eyes doesnt 'blend' well with the bones around the eyes
"Honestly, I think the product is fantastic, but personally I don't find them to be comfortable. BUT! I love using them when I practice my meditation. So honestly, I like it, it has a purpose, sleep wise, it's not for me, maybe i should've got the heavier one for my eyes. I see ppl here enjoy it, and that's awesome, I'm happy to see it helps others get proper rest. Maybe I just need to try a different one. My sleep is terrible. But hey! For Meditation it works!"
"First off, I do really like this mask, however, it is not for everyone. This mask only works as described perfectly, but only if you are a back sleeper or using it for use on an airplane/other mode of travel while you sleep in a chair.  The design does not remain reliable if you're a side sleeper.  Your pillow will push your eye cup out of place letting light in and put slight pressure on your nose.All in all I will keep this mask for travel, but this is not my go to mask for regular sleep"
The cups for your eyes work great and block out all sun but the cups are also very thick so if you are a side or stomach sleeper it's too much. Presses into your eye sockets. These would be great for people if you only sleep on your back!
"I was hesitant on purchasing this because half the time I buy things to get better rest and it doesn't work; however, this product actually works. I work an odd schedule and before this mask, I would wake up and see the sun out, thus it would be hard for me to rest knowing I was spending my day sleeping for work. After buying this, I have slept up to my alarm and i have gotten some of the best rest using these. These are also very comfortable to wear as well no matter your sleeping position. It's well worth the purchase."
"My friend recommended this eye mask and so I figured I would give it a try. This eye mask is overall fantastic - you can easily adjust the eye pockets to fit your eye. The eye pockets are deep enough where you can blink/open your eyes with the mask on with comfort. The eye sockets and strap fit so that it does not cause discomfort from being too tight, but it feels weightless. The only downside to this eye mask is that it is large and big, so it is not compact for traveling. You can still easily travel with this, it just takes up a little more room. Overall, I am very happy with this eye mask and anticipate I will use it for years!"
"I have a big nose, normal masks end up having gaps because my nose pushes it off of my face a little, and I also have issues with tighter masks putting too much pressure on my nose which makes me unable to breathe, this mask solves both problems. The eye cups are Velcro and can be repositioned to get a perfect fit, they are extremely comfortable, and the strap is also very comfortable. I think the price is still a little high for the product, but I am completely happy that I purchased one."
I love how mask eye cups are adjustable and the velcro doesnt get tangled in my hair. It is very comfortable to sleep in and blocks lots of light. I highly recommend this product.
"This is the best eye mask EVER! Totally blackout mask. Will accommodate back/side sleepers. The Manta company apparently no longer sells this specific product, but I was lucky to find it on amazon. I should order several more! I wear it nightly, and they can be laundered. However, after about 18 months, the elastic stretches out and I replace it. If you're looking for a perfect eye mask, THIS IS THE ONE!!!"
"I usually don't write reviews, however this deserves a review. I work night shift and previously used a cheap sleeping mask that never helped me get a goodnight sleep. This mask is soft, comfortable and gentle on the eyes and instantly blocks the light making it easier to fall asleep. The adjustable velcro strap stays on well and it's not tight around my head. I highly recommend this product for those who work night shift or just have trouble sleeping at night."
"I have tested a few different eye masks over the last eight months.  Manta is the best so far.  Could use a bit more space for one's eyelashes, but that isn't a deal breaker."
Ever since I started working night shift I've needed an eye mask to sleep. This eye mask is unbeatable!! It's extremely comfy and it blocks out ALL the light!! I can't go to sleep without it!
"My wife is breastfeeding our newborn and turns the bedroom light on for feedings. This mask is perfect.  It blocks out 100% of the light, is comfortable and adjustable. I am a stomach sleeper and this is as about as comfortable as it can get with a pillow in your face. The eyeholes are perfect thick pillows for your eyes and allow you to blink without touching the mask. This is adjustable to any adult face and size."
"I cannot even begin to tell you how much I love this eye mask!! Not only is it very comfortable to wear, but it causes me to have a complete blackout of light! I have slept with this in bright rooms and even while napping outside in my swing under the full sun and it's the best sleep mask I've ever had! I love that not only is the band adjustable but you can even move the eye pads! I didn't need to alter them, but I'm sure others may and it would be a godsend! The mask itself is very soft and with the thicker headband being adjustable, I'm able to adjust the exact fit that works best for me! Previous masks did not have an adjustable band or ""eye cups"" and I was forced to tie knots in order to tighten it, which caused great discomfort. I also had great difficulty with those masks staying put. I do place this under my shoulder length hair, as I've done with the others, and it stayed in the proper position. I'm not sure how well it would hold on short hair/no hair. If you are someone who needs the light to be 100% filtered out for sleeping well, this is the mask for you! Per my title, I give this 100/10!"
"After several nights use, the mask works only well when sleeping on your back. This was disappointing because I always sleep on one side of the other. The eye cups do well for blocking the light but do not allow for comfortable sleeping on one's side, they are just too thick. The lack of side sleeping comfort is the reason for the rating above."
The mask blocked out all the light. I am a prone and/or side sleeper. The mask was not at all comfortable when trying to sleep in those positions. The padding on the lower part of the mask felt uncomfortable around my cheek bones. I tried various combinations of strap positioning and it did not help. Returned for refund.
"Does this block light? Yes. Does it allow you to sleep on your side or stomach without feeling like you are laying down with glasses on? No.This would probably work just fine for solely back sleepers, but if you turn on your side or stomach you'll likely find yourself adjusting the mask since it moved and was pushed and trying to find a good spot to rest your head. I end up tearing this mask off before I get to sleep because of that."
"On theory this is a great product. It blocks out light pretty well. As a side sleeper though, this did not work for me.What would happen is that the cup would end up putting pressure in my eye. Since the cup is adjustable I kept fiddling with it to see if I could keep this from happening, but alas was unsuccessful. After 3 nights of restless had to stop using it."
"These would be great if I didn't sleep on my stomach. I find that I need to reposition the mask because my pillow would move it as I moved around in bed. The extra pressure applied from the pillow also restricted my breathing enough for me to get annoyed and have to take it off. Otherwise, they would be great for anyone else."
"This product works similarly to the original Manta Mask but this one has a slimmer backstrap.My original lasted me for years before the velcro backing wore out.  This one works almost as well in blacking out but it is not as comfortable.The newer design should last longer than the original, but if I was going to make a new purchase I would wait on the silk model to come out."
I tried for about 3 weeks and never could get used to it. I'm a side sleeper and I find it puts pressure on the side of my eye socket. I also toss a little bit and this thing always moves when I switch from side to side. I tried to make it tighter to stay in place but then it gave me a headache. Overall it didn't help my normal sleep but I have used it on the plane a few times and it's been great for that so I'll keep it. Unfortunate because I was really excited for it!
Found it uncomfortable and couldn't stop light from getting in around my nose. Not worth the $35.
"The mask blocks all light and is very comfortable when I first put it on, but I am a side sleeper and it seems to be made for back sleepers. I wish this had been mentioned in the description. When I am on my side, the bottom part pushes into my brow bone and temple in an uncomfortable manner. It also pushes the top cup upwards, allowing some light in.  If you are a back sleeper, I highly recommend, but side sleepers keep looking!"
"Soft and covers the area. The eye donuts are adjustable and that's helpful. The design is great in general but to keep it on and in place, it has to be tight."
"Some people may think it ""sleeps hot"", although that isn't bothering me. It feels kooky at first because there are these pronounced foam rings around the eyes inside which hold the mask away from the lashes and eyelids. These rings really do work for that. No pressure on my eyes, and I can open my eyes all the way without feeling the mask. The mask fastens with a Velcro-type closure in back, and I don't like mashing my hair down with it, so I put it under my hair; it tends to slip a little. But that is okay since I end up on my side and I have to adjust my mask a bit for that. Some people may not care for that; it is the thickness of the mask that requires me to move the mask around when on my side. The best thing: I didn't know how much I was bothered by light coming in around my window, but with the mask I am falling asleep almost immediately. It is becoming a bit of a bedtime ritual. I put on the mask, and ""lights out"", literally and figuratively! (June 2023: I am editing this to update.) The other night, I woke to visit the bathroom, and wondered at there being no light at all in the room as I walked to the door, eyes wide open. Until I realized I was still wearing the mask! That is how comfortable I, the ""Princess And The Pea"", am finding the mask, despite my misgivings at the beginning. I didn't even know I still had it on."
I Love it!!!
"Started working graveyard shift and tried multiple sleep masks before this one and all of them were pretty uncomfortable and light would shine through the bottom. This mask has been perfect. It's comfortable to wear at night and and doesn't let any light through. You can also adjust the eye pads to fit your face better. I wish I would have started with this mask from the beginning, instead of trying other products before this one."
"I love this sleep mask. I work nights and have to sleep during the day. I've used other masks, but they're usually a little too tight for comfort if they are going to stay on. The manta is very comfortable and does a fantastic job of blocking out all the light in the room."
This is a great mask. I got it to wear with my CPAP because it is so adjustable. I am a side sleeper and it works great. I recommend!
"I had a friend recommend this mask to me, they were right. I was a little skeptical of the product at first due to their heavy focus on marketing and advertisement, but the quality of the sleep mask is there to back it up. It's comfortable and does a great job at keeping out light."
I haven't had this kind of sleep in years. I'm shocked.
"I don't know how I slept without it. Comfortable, dark, soft, and it just feels like home now."
"Over the course of time I've tried numerous sleep masks. The worst (most) bled black onto my pillowcases. How can you manufacture a black mask with dye that runs? They all had gaps around the nose that let the light in. Many had band features that rub that delicate spot just over one's ears. These? These are great in every way. They don't bleed. At all. The cups completely block the light. Completely.  I am a side sleeper, and even though the cups have a bit bulk, they are soft, and tapered towards the temple; I can sleep on them with the side of my face smooshed into the pillow.  The velcro band has the perfect amount of elasticity and adjusts snuggly. The eye cups are adjustable for width and facial structure as well. I'm really happy I found these. I'm a quintessential princess and the pea type sleeper, easily disturbed, and I find these comfortable and comforting, and while this sounds like an ad, I'm volunteering this with nothing in return. I'm just grateful for all the thoughtful features and going out of my way to say."
"Very comfortable and will help you sleep in full light conditions, I used it i my last trip to Bangkok... I wish I had this on my may other trips love it and highly recommend"
"I had to fuss with the eye cups a bit to get them to a position where they didn't put pressure on my nose. However, in order to completely block light, I really had to tighten the strap, which put pressure around the eye cups and made the mask very uncomfortable. I went back to a lightweight Bucky. I let my mom try this one, though, and she immediately liked it. To each their own, I guess."
"Worked well, but was uncomfortable while side sleeping and I constantly had to adjust it. I had marks on my face from the mask when i woke up for hours, too. It was too bulky and would get knocked off or moved when I slept on my side. Wish I could return it but I already threw away the box and tried it out."
"I tried this for a about a week and a half and couldn't get comfortable with it at all. I'm a side sleeper and this was not made for side sleepers in mind. Its made very well, with customization in mind, but couldn't ever get it comfortable enough. The opposite was true for me. I woke several times before a complete nights rest with the mask flung across the room. I subconsciously did this and was wondering why the light from the next morning was waking me up. Just wasn't a good fit for me."
Wanted to like this mAsk so much but it was very uncomfortable as I am a side sleeper and the eye cups kept pressing into my head.
"Works well, but does not work well with a full face CPAP mask. So of limited use to me."
"I had to get this because I just had eye surgery and I'm a stomach sleeper. Unfortunately the ""cushion"" around the eyes was so stiff and uncomfortable. If the masks shifts at all while you sleep, it digs into your eyes. Maybe this is better for someone sleeps on their back, but it is definitely not for me"
"If you really have to have a completely zero light mask this is probably worth a try due to it's customized fit options, but only if you only sleep only on your back. Side and stomach sleepers will find this too thick and bulky to be comfortable as the thicker part around the eyes will compete with your head and pillow for space."
"Product design is poor for side sleepers. The eye pads are thick and the mask slips when turning in bed and ends up putting pressure against eyes which is very uncomfortable. The materials are high quality, just want to clarify that. If they came up with a different design i would buy from them again. My boyfriend bought a sleep mask from them a few years back and i loved it.....bit the eye pads were thin and not uncomfortable."
"The eye cups work well for blocking light, but this mask simply is not made for side sleepers. The thickness of the strap isn't what matters for sleeping on your side; it is the thickness of the eye cups. If your head is truly on its side, then the eye cup will crush into your face somehow. It's not terrible, but this mask is far from ""the best sleep mask"" for side sleepers."
"Tried out different masks. Manta mask is relatively comfortable. Bottom strap need to be wider compared to the top strap (one with the velcro). With current design lining up strap with velcro to the bottom strap is not convenient.Some light does come in through the bottom part of the nose bridge. There need to be a nose bridge flap piece similar to the one used by Mavogel and other brands (Unimi,Reebent,Sontec: available on Amazon) to block light coming through the bottom side of the nose bridge.  Depth and comfort of the eye cushions are better compared to the other similar masks on Amazon. Price is high."
"I got this mask because I have been having issues getting/staying asleep. I work overnights and have to sleep during the day. It's super adjustable where the eye cups go and the head strap. Once I got a proper fit on the eye cups, it was blackout. It's super comfy to wear and I'm a side sleeper."
"Love the Manta sleep mask sorry for the late review but i really wanted to test the product for a long time before I wrote an official review. It's a really good mask to use for sleep i been using it for over a year it helps me sleep when everyone is awake, and they have lights on, and I also like it for days when I sleep late, and it keeps the sun out of my face. It's a really great product its almost hard to sleep without it on anymore it becomes a really important item like if it goes missing or you can't find it, you're going to search your house and do your best to find it Because you'll sleep better when you wear it."
"buy it, don't get any other brand or style. this is the one. i love how the straps velcro instead of that sliding mechanism on most sleep masks. makes it last longer and is super comfortable"
Look no further.  These are the best sleep masks I e ever used.
Love love love will buy again. I normally hate anything on my face. I have an 8 hour flight coming up and I am so happy to have this.
This mask works with my nasal cushion Cpap mask.
"I stupidly don't have black out curtains so in the last 3-4 years have resorted to eye masks to avoid disrupting my sleep in the early morning.While Manta Sleep Mask is probably double the cost of most you'll see on Amazon, it is 100% worth the cost. Good sleep is priceless and the ROI has been huge for me.The velcro adjuster is so much more sturdy than the finicky buckle adjuster in others that becomes twisted and useless after a month. The eye cups are comfortable and fully black out light. Plus you can swap them out when they get worn out or to change to hot/cold models.I've gotten some of my best sleep in a year since getting these. If you're on the fence, jump off it and get these."
"Se filtra algo de luz por abajo, pero en general cumplen el cometido para el los compré"
"The best part about this mask is the consistency it brings to your ""sleep environment"". Regardless of your location, when you close your eyes, you'll feel the comforting embrace of your eye mask :) total blackout, so daylight & tv light are of no effect. Would definitely recommend."
"Great way to completely block out all light. Very comfortable to sleep in, very adjustable to any head size and eye width. Comfortable fabric."
It looks like it would work better than it does. Light still seeps through. Not the most comfortable/ effective device if you move around while you sleep. I do like the hook and loop closure but I expected more for the price.
"This is not a bad mask. To get the mask to seal, I have to tighten it. I have a deviated nostril. So, the masks cause a lot of nasal pressure.  If the eye covers were made of a softer foam I do not think this would be a problem. Overall the mask is good quality, though."
"The foam is flat and has no contour. Which means you need a lot of force to make it curve around the face and seal. Thats too much pressure, both on the eyes(surroundings) , and on the head band.Maybe its just the shape of my head? I am not really sure. but if I have really sleep with it, then its too much pressure.The head band is too thick. Especially since the velcro overlaps on the back of head, where you lie down. The overall bulk also means when turning my head around, it tends to get pressed and torn. That doesn't feel good.The whole thing feels soft and nice. But practically does not fit for sleeping. But if you just wanna lie down and take a power nap, it may be very good."
"Took a little while to get used to, kept ripping it off my face at night, but it blocks out the light great, and after a week I was sleeping longer."
"I originally got this product so my eyelashes would not be squished. The mask is great for that purpose, has tons of space for your eyes, and keeps the light out.I think the mask would be great for back sleepers. But the eyecups are quite uncomfortable if you sleep on your sides. They interfere with the pillow and push on your face. Both nights I tried to use it, I ended up switching back to my old one in the middle of the night. My eyebrows would also be sore from the constant pressure of the eyecups.It might work for some sidesleepers, but for me it did not."
"I was so hopeful for this product but if I loosen it at all, it doesn't stay on my face and I wake up without it. If I tighten it, it is too tight for my face and causes a panic."
Adjusting the eye pieces on my own had been a challenge. It's comfortable enough wearing to bed but I never seem to have it on when I wake up. It seems to help with light going to bed.
"I liked how soft and comfortable it was on my eyes, but the band kept slipping and the mask move up on my forehead while I was sleeping.  Might try a different version like the silk or weighted one instead."
I purchased this and the Dreamlight Ease 3D sleep mask at the same time.  I wanted a mask that would allow me to drift off to sleep while my spouse watched TV from our bed.  I liked this mask at first but after a couple uses I became frustrated with the light leakage around the bottom of the mask.  It is also a little uncomfortable as the pieces over the eyes place extra pressure on my face when I lay on my stomach.  The material is very light weight and light does not penetrate through it; However it can leak through the bottom.  This item does not get warm in the same manner that the Dreamlight does so that is a plus.  I think it is a good alternative and much better than any of the cheap masks that I have used - but I do prefer the Dreamlight Ease.
"The idea is great in theory but in execution it's just an overpriced eye mask. The velcro looses it's stick after a short period of time, the cups don't create the ""seal"" they are advertised too and you just end up paying extra for what is ultimately just a gimmick. Save yourself some time and money and just go with a basic classic satin eye mask. It will do just fine and will work just as well if not better for a significantly lower price point."
This mask is better than any other for on in regard to total darkness. There's no place for light to slip in. The only downside is sometimes it helps it keep out the light also creates a little pressure around the ocular space.
"I would give this 5 stars but am only giving 4 bc there could be major improvements if your a lash wearer. I have lash extensions, I didnt want to pay the high price, it wasnt on sale when I bought it either so for this 35$ sale I would have been grateful. It could be a little better but for the most part as a CRAZY stomach and side sleeper its made it so I dont have to pay extra when getting my lash fills. So for someone who isn't such a crazy sleeper like me it would work amazing. but for us hard crazy stomach sleepers so far this is the best one I have found. Do not waste money on the cheaper ones. I have not used the silk one, but its the same size so I assume its the same as far as keeping on lashes goes, I could be wrong... It also comes with a little zip bag to place it in when you wake up, and the eye holes come off if u need to wash it, for someone like me who is 100000000000% into night skincare serums and routine it looks ""dirty"" faster but you can wash the holes and all of it if u wanted to. stays in place for the most part good, once in a while it will slip off if im sleeping really hard. in conclusion, this lash protection eye sleep mask is the best I have found online or in stores. Worth it if you constantly get fills and individual lash extensions. If I had the money I would design one that would be perfect but sadly I dont :( so this will do for now <3 hope this helps..."
"I thought this would be good since the fabric is stiff and won't lose shape but I found the fabric to be too stiff. in the middle of the night, I found myself adjusting the velcro because it was too tight on my head. The sound of that velcro in the middle of the night was very loud. I thought it would wake up my husband.  The good thing is the velcro didn't stick to my hair. When sleeping on my side, the eye cups dug into my face. It is of good quality. There was a lot of thought that went into making this adjustable. It just didn't work for me."
"Preforms how it should and works great. Except it causes puffiness that I never experience otherwise in the morning. It also seems to pull my skin which gives me anxiety about it causing wrinkles. I sleep on my side and it seems to shift my eyeball to the side lol the foam around the eyes is really firm - too firm for my liking and it shifts my whole eye/skin around my eye when I have the side of my face squished into the pillow. Maybe this would be better for back sleepers. I'm sad it messed up my face so much, otherwise I would love the total blackout quality."
Very comfortable. Little light was poking through but i think its my face shape.
"I recently purchased a MZOO sleep mask, which I ended up being quite satisfied with. However, the strap started to stretch and I found that I was constantly tightening it to compensate (and this was only three month after purchasing it), so I began to search for something more durable. After reading other reviews, the Manta sleep mask seemed to fit the bill and I decided to give it a try. Out of the box I could tell that this thing was built to  last (and at about $30 it better be). The inside of the straps are lined with a really soft material and are secured in place with a microfiber strap, similar to velcro, and are advertised as triple-reinforced. They did not give easily, so I could tell they would not stretch and be permanently damaged as easily as my previous mask. Hmmm only complaint with the strap is that because of this extra reinforcement, it's hard not to notice the feeling of the strap putting pressure on your head as you sink into the pillow, even after 15-20 minutes when you would normally forget you have a mask on.The eyelets are moveable, but did not move themselves over time, as someone said in another review. They block out about 95-100% of the ambient light, but are not quite as comfortable as the MZOO mask, which is why I'll be returning mine. I am both a side sleeper, as well as a back sleeper. Thus, softness is crucial. I found that since the eyelets on the Manta sleep mask are rather firm, they would put more pressure on the area around my eye if I slept on my sides, making falling asleep more difficult. I often awoke to find that I'd removed the mask whilst sleeping. I'd put it back on and awake to find that I'd taken it off again.In short, if you want a mask that will block out most, if not all, light and will last, this is it. It even comes with a small netted bag for you to was the mask in, which is rather convenient since the eyelets would come off during wash cycles. However, if you want something really comfortable, look elsewhere."
"This is a great eye mask, but it's a little uncomfortable for side sleepers. The round part of the eyes hits my pillow too much. I tried moving the eye pieces more inwards but it didn't help much. A bit of light does slip through in the morning after moving around all night, which creates gap under my eyes, but it's not too bad."
"I'm a back sleeper and have tried several masks. This mask is very durable, soft to the touch, and comfortable around the eyes. I appreciate how easy it is to adjust the eye pads to match your face. I've had mine for months now and it's still in just as good of condition as the day I bought it, which is something I've struggled with for other masks. Most other masks usually started falling apart after several trips through the washer, this one holds up well.I will agree with other reviews that state that the back of the head could be more comfortable, but that really hasn't been an issue for me and was something I just got used to. I would also agree that it's not a design that suits people who sleep in any other position other than their back, as it becomes awkward and doesn't sit well anymore. But since it's very rare that I don't sleep on my back, I love this product.Overall, I've been very happy with this product and think is you're primarily a back sleeper, this will be a good purchase for you. If you sleep on your side or your face, I'd recommend a mask that doesn't have the eye cups and sits more flat on your face so it doesn't move when you lay on your side."
Comfortable and does a great job blocking light.  Is a bit hot if you are a hot sleeper.
I'm only posting this review with the horrific picture to show fit interface between masks.  I also can't give 5 stars because while this mask is the best fit out of 3 masks I've tried it's not perfect.  If your looking for a mask that works with pillow nasal mask this might do the truck for you.  So far after two nights it's been the best I've tried thus far.  I hope this review helps other CPAP / bipap users out there.
"Full dark is vital for sleep, and if you are looking for the right sleep mask, this is it.I needed a sleep mask because I am a night shift worker and it is crucial to be able to fall asleep when the sun is already up.I was hesitant about using a sleep mask because I did not want anything pressing into my eyes. I gave these a try and loved them right away. They are lightweight, soft, comfortable, and do a fabulous job blocking out all light.They are constructed with a pillow-like inner tube that fits gently over your eyes for black-out function without putting pressure on your face.It takes a little trial and error for adjusting the fit to your comfort. As a back-sleeper, I have had no issues with these moving around during sleep or creating any discomfort. Even if I roll into my side temporarily, this mask still remains comfortably in place, doing it's sweet job of blocking light until I am ready to let the light in."
"This thing is awesome! It comes with Velcro detachable eye pieces and the foam cushion around it perfect protects my lashes without causing any discomfort or raccoon eyes in the morning. Does the job, and was so worth it!"
"I've purchased an insane amount of sleep masks from Amazon, and after trying out (and disliking) numerous ones, I can confidently say that this is the best one I've come across! It's not only supremely comfortable and soft, but it also effectively blocks out all light and can be adjusted to fit various face shapes and sizes. Yes, it's a little pricey compared to others but if you're in search of the perfect sleep mask, look no further. This one won't let you down!"
Worth it if you don't like making your room super dark.
"It feels weird and uncomfortable the first night but once you get used to it, it's fantastic at blocking light."
"If you're on a plane, in a car, train & are in a seated position where you can't roll over, you won't find anything better than this. I love that I can wear these and blink my eyes with fast strobe light speeds and not once have my eyelashes touch. When I sleep I absolutely hate any pressure on my eyes so I absolutely love these."
Took a while to get the eye cups in the right place but now that it is it's comfortable and completely dark. I can't even tell when the lights are on when wearing the mask
One of the best light blockers I've used.
My eyes do not close all the way when I sleep which results in chronic dry eyes and eye pain… think of a raisin in the sun. Normal sleep masks do not prevent moisture evaporation but this sleep mask has little ‘chambers' for your eyes and it's a very comfortable mask to sleep with. I strongly recommend.
"I've tried many different sleep masks and this is the only one that 100% blocks out all light! It's a 3d type cup design so it doesn't press into your eyes nor hit your eyelashes, it so comfortable to sleep in. It's also customizable, if there's light seeping in, adjust the eye cups or loosen or tighten it by adjusting the head strap. Well worth the price because it's customizable, blocks out all light, comfortable, and is washable, and doesn't cause discomfort or rubbing of the eye or eyelashes. The perfect sleep mask! I highly recommend this!"
"I've only had it about a week, but I am sleeping better. Not only does it block the light but subliminally, when I put it on, my brain is beginning to get the message that it is time to wind down and I am falling asleep faster than usual. When I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, I just slide it up to my forehead and then back down over my eyes. The soft, cushiony feel around my eye sockets is a nice, gentle pressure, and are deep enough that they don't press against my eyelids. The only thing that keeps this from a 5 star is the strap around the back would be better if it was a double strap with a high and low placement that might reduce slippage during the night as I am a ""rotisserie sleeper""."
This mask doesn't completely block out the light unless you squeeze it on your face… which would be uncomfortable and therefore counterproductive. The rings are just donuts that doesn't fit your face contours perfectly. Still very soft and the best eye mask I've bought-  the most expensive aswell.
"It works really great, the only thing is by morning it always comes off my head."
The sleep mask itself is great!  It feels good while you have it strapped on and the Velcro fastener makes it stay on even through my chaotic sleep throws.  The earplugs that come with it are kinda meh though.  If you try to roll them to apply them properly in your ear.  They reform too fast and as a result I can't hardly get them in my ear canal. That was just a added bonus though and the mask itself is wonderful.  I highly recommend it.
"I really do love this product. Much more comfortable than other sleep masks. I thought the eye pockets would be a downfall because I thought I enjoyed weight on my eyes from a regular mask, but turns out those little pockets are heavenly (and adjustable!). They truly are blackout, zero light peaks in these babies. The only drawback is I'm a back and side sleeper, so they're bulky and uncomfortable when I roll on my side. Maybe this will change as I get used to them, or maybe I'll transition into a complete back sleeper over time. I'm a night shift worker and these are a way better investment than blackout curtains. It's like a pure black abyss inside these guys!"
"I am a very light sleeper. And have a bright room in the morning. Any little sunlight wakes me up. This sleep mask is... ok..  it definitely blocks out about 95% of the light.  However,  the other 5% i see. The eye pads are round and holo so as to not press on your eyeballs.  But i would have rather it be a solid piece to cover my eye.  The  holo-ness allows you to open your eyes with the mask on. And that makes the part of the mask right in from of your eyes thinner. This allows just a hint if light in. Overall though, not bad. I still get more sleep with it on than i do without it. And its super soft and comfortable to wear."
"It's better than the eyelid irritation from regular masks, and better st blocking light too, but it still doesn't line up properly over the eyes properly because of the nose.The eye pads should be a little thinner and arch inward a bit near the nose."
"These are well designed and well made. They are very light weight.For me, it was uncomfortable trying to sleep with these on. I sleep on my back, so these didn't exactly fail, I just couldn't get comfortable."
"I bought a few sleep masks and these are the best, if you're not a direct side sleeper or sleep on your stomach.  They stick out too far for those.  For a car, plane, or back sleeper these are amazing and the best you will find."
"This mask doesn't touch my eyelids at all, which I like, and I didn't have any trouble with the strap over my ears, but it is somewhat uncomfortable if you're a side sleeper. The eye cups need to be more tapered on the outside edge. It blocks out light really well, though, and does a good job of preventing me from rubbing my eyes in my sleep."
"I got the sleep mask to try and help me with my sleep. I also wear ear plugs.Unfortunately, it hasn't helped me as much and I don't really believe that's to much fault of the company. It does what it does and it does it well, it blacks out light fairly comfortably, but side sleepers may struggle a bit.I often found myself waking up with the mask around my neck or completely off, and that may just be a personal issue. I tried to put it tighter but sometimes that would be comfortable.That said, the quality of my sleep didn't change that much so I contacted customer service and they helped me out. Definitely recommend it if you struggle with light."
"Probably the closest to full blackout I've seen so far. It's design does tend to make it stick out a bit further than most eye masks which makes some sleeping positions difficult.I've noticed sleeping on your side can cause the mask to shift a little and let a small amount of light in, though it's not unmanageable. The fact that the eye cups are Velcro'd in place means you can adjust for eye spacing and with some carful tweaking you can even adjust for some slight shifting when side sleeping."
"I didn't realize the little black mesh bag was to wash the mask in, and I had washed it without it a few times. One of the eye cups lost its shape, and they quickly responded with a new mask for me.I like this mask because it's not as hot as other masks, and does block out more light.  It is also more comfortable because it's not pressing on my eyeballs, lol."
"it took some finagling but the 100% light blocking does work with (probably) all faces due to their adjustable eyepad design. I am a side sleeper and am still going to use it because it's velcro in the back which makes the band more resistant to stretching over time, but it does smoosh against my face/nose a little when pressed against the bed."
"This really does block out everything IF you have it adjusted correctly. Once it's on you have to fiddle with the eye ""cups"" a bit for it to block out the light around your nose. Literally takes a second though. I have a smaller face and I find that the tightest option is still fairly loose on me. That's a little disappointing. The cups don't smash my eyelashes as bad as other eye masks. (My eyelashes are natural, but very long.)Side sleepers: In order to protect your forehead from wrinkling with this on, make sure you gently lift up the top of the mask once you are settled in onto your pillow. If you don't do this, it can ""scrunch"" up your forehead a bit and may cause wrinkles."
"It's almost perfect. If the foam cups were a little bigger it would be easier and you won't have pressure on your eyes when laying on your side. But honestly it's the best that's out there, really comfortable and great for travel. I used to use it everyday but I sleep a lot while I move so it kinda moves around. It would be great if the band was designed way above the ears so that the band isn't irritating the ears"
"It is surprisingly comfortable and completely blacks out all light.Plenty of adjustability with the Velcro backing on each eye cover.It never became gross and does a good job of repelling dust, dirt, grime, and smells.The elastic strap stretches and looses quite a bit of strength. If my head was any smaller, it wouldn't work after a year. You could always add a new connector or closure."
It takes some adjusting and I mean you adjust it sleep in it and then adjust it some more to fit correctly. The eye covers come completely off and can be adjusted. There's also a strap on the back that adjusts which you can see from the picture. It doesn't touch your eyelids which bothered me about other eye covers. I work nights so until we get new blackout blinds these are great.
"My nose is such a pushover that any mask I tried using basically collapsed it and made it hard to breathe. This one works great because I can separate the cups further apart and allow room to breathe. I would say that if I was buying it again, I'd get the cool cups and the slim band. The cups aren't necessarily warm, but having a cooler material would feel much more refreshing. The band works fine but I dislike that it has to sit across my ears to fit properly."
Just an absolutely wonderful mask
It would be really nice if this mask would stay on my head all night...without having to be so tight that it affected my ears negatively....but the blackout features are tied for the best of the 5 Amazon masks I've bought this year.
"My husband says I have a baby head. This is just too big for my face. The eye pockets, which are fabulous in theory, are just too big."
These are too bulky and difficult to keep on if you sleep on your side or stomach.
"I had high hopes for this mask, but it was the most uncomfortable eye mask I've worn to-date.  I'm returning it."
"These do black out all light, however they really aren't at all comfy.  I'm a side sleeper, I would imagine they would be perfect for a back sleeper, but I cant wear them at all."
I thought I would like the eye part but I realize I don't. Still trying to find a happy medium with this thing.
"The 2 circular pads make their presence felt.I tried loosening the back strap but, still."
The eye cups added too much pressure to my eyes and not comfortable for side sleeping.
"I wanted to like the Manta because it did block light around my nose unlike other masks, but the thick foam around your eyes gets hot crazy fast and made it impossible to sleep."
I wanted to like this mask. I'm a side sleeper and the round eye cups dig into my eye socket and I get light in the gaps by my nose
"This is a tough one to review. I've had these for a little over a month now and every night I'm trying to figure out whether I like it or not.First off, it is pretty comfortable but not all the time. As soon as you roll over to the side the eye foam cups start being pushed into the corners of your eyes. Every single night I find myself adjusting the eye cups at least 3-5 times before falling asleep. I actually think this cupping system they have going here is the biggest flaw because it's always shifting around.I much rather prefer my gf's $5 sleep mask which has a thick border between my eyes and the mask so my eyelashes don't touch it.This mask is probably good for those that don't move around or just sleep on their backs.Not worth the $35 in my opinion"
"Quality is good, shipped fast, just not what I thought it would be for the price. If you are a side sleeper this is NOT for you."
I'm a rotisserie chicken sleeper and these are just not good for anything but back sleeping. They buckle and the bulk of the cups aren't really that pillowy. I've tried every adjustment possible. I was so sad. I'd been looking at them for years.Good for migraines and overstimulation though.
"I'm a side sleeper, and I find that the mask pushes into my eye socket, and it's difficult to find a comfortable position to use it.  Because it's jammed into my eye, it squishes the mask and light gets in.  I don't care how I adjust it (and it does have a lot of adjustability), it lets in light and jabs my eye because it protrudes so much.  Looking for another one that will do a better job."
"This is certainly a well-made product and relatively versatile with the adjustable eye pads. However, I found my face got just too warm at night. It would also be nice if there were a product made that was thinner and more breathable. Of course, this is my personal preference."
"After about 6 months of nightly use, the velcro in the back stopped working. Relatively comfortable and completely black-out otherwise."
"My husband and I are traveling to a destination that has 24 hours of sunlight so we purchased this product. While these work for my husband, they unfortunately were not for me. While I could not see any light, I found these very uncomfortable when sleeping on my side. They created a lot of pressure and discomfort on my cheek bones."
"To be fair, these are comfortable and do an excellent job of delivering complete darkness. With the foam eye rings, which are adjustable, you get a very good result IF you're only laying on your back.I found that when trying to sleep on my side or stomach it was nearly impossible to keep them on correctly. The foam creates an extension away from your face and is easily moved if you'rea stomach sleeper. It also created uncomfortable pressure on my eyes when laying in a position that had either eye on my pillow.Again, great for a back sleeper or if you're looking for completely darkness but not ideal for side or stomach sleep."
I bought a new one to replace my old one and the straps are different and I find the new straps make it harder to adjust for fitting 😕
They are soft but really mediocre. Don't Like them. Went back to my old one. Way over engineered  I want function not style in a sleep mask.
I was very disappointed with the product once I tried to use it. After having Surgery on my eyes I figured this would be ideal to wear at night while sleeping. It was too suffocating to wear throughout the night a uncomfortable. Too expensive to not feel comfortable
"If you sleep on your back, you should be fine.  But for side sleepers, it will move around unless you put it on super tight."
Too foamy for the eyes and my husband head hurts and got a headache from it so it sucked. But my parents liked it 3 stars XD
"While I was hoping to protect my eyes from myself, a side sleeper, it came in contact with my eyes when I tried to sleep with it. Would be perfect for a back sleeper though."
"The product does well to block light, but it is not meant for stomach sleepers. With my face turned to the side or into my pillow, the thickness of the cups put too much pressure to the bony areas around my eyes."
Worse than anything else if you have above average size ears or want to sleep on your side/stomach.
Not very slim. Cups are adjustable but not meant for users of CPAP machines.
The cups are so thing you can see all the light coming through them
"It does stay on great every night it comes off. It is comfortable, but I worry when the hot summer nights hit that I won't wear it because it does breathe well. My eyes get hot now. :("
She said it was fine until she rolled on her side. Not for side sleepers.
"Great eye mask. Trust me, buy this one before buying others! I wish I had before purchasing 3 other cheaper ones that did not meet my expectations! This one is comfortable for my eyes and 100% takes out the light"
"Wow. Love love love. Basically wish I'd found a year ago love fit material and fit, no more dry eye, doesn't touch eyes, Thank you very much."
"I've owned hundreds of sleep mask over the years. This is the best, by far. There is a learning curve on getting the adjustment right but after you do, you won't think about buying another brand sleep mask again."
This mask is incredible and I love it but for some reason with this one I always take it off in my sleep and sometimes the feeling of it being so close to my nose feels like I can't breathe even though I can. I tried spreading the eye covers farther apart but it hasn't seemed to work I had a super cheap that I didn't take off but I'm going to keepTrying lol
"A really nice sleep mask, nice build quality and not irritating"
"I borrow one of these from my friend before I ordered so I knew what I was getting before I got it, but I have to say that these sleep masks are a godsend. No light gets through and comfy to sleep in too. If you work the night shift or need to sleep during the day for whatever reason I would highly recommend!"
"I'm used to wearing the little sleep masks that are normally four or five masks for less than $10 on a lightening deal. While comfortable they don't stay in place, don't fully block light & get in the way of my P30i CPAP frame with nasal pillows mask. The slim manta is perfect in so many ways. First, it is slim enough that it does not touch my CPAP.  It is light weight & very comfortable - after the first couple of nights of getting used to it feeling different on my face than my previous sleep masks. It seems cooler because not so much of my face is covered. I sleep on my back or side & it functions properly in both positions. It truly is 100% blackout. If a person is still getting light leakage then it's not adjusted properly for their face. It doesn't have to be too tight to block the light either. If the cups are in the right place all it needs is gentle pressure from the strap to keep them there. Finally, I have a severe natural rubber latex allergy and tried this mask based on the comments from others with the same allergy after reading reviews on all of the manta masks, and I also have zero reaction to the mask."
"Okay, so granted I've only used it once, but I slept like a rock. Even at night I'm pretty sensitive to light. A hall light comes on, my wife looking at her phone, etc.I slept all night and didn't move at all. That never happens.Also, I use a CPAP with a Dreamwear mask, which is essentially a big loop that goes under the nose and over the top of the head. The whole thing is a passageway for air. I was concerned that this might either restrict airflow or cause noise from the air coming out. I'm very happy to report that neither of these was an issue. If anything, it helps hold the CPAP mask in place even better.The quality of this mask is excellent. It's extremely soft and comfortable, and once adjusted properly, truly blocks out 100% of the light. I can turn on and off the lamp right next to my head and honestly can't tell if it's on or not. Highly recommended!"
"I purchased this on Amazon as a Christmas gift for a friend - I've been using Manta sleep masks for almost 2 years and have several of their masks!I got manta originally with a discount code from a youtuber (AMYKAY, on manta's site not Amazon) without much hope that it'd be worth it. But from day 1 I loved it; it truly blocks out ALL light! And it's so comfortable - it's a velcro adjustable band, so it's only as tight as you want it to be. NOTHING is touching your eyes or eyelashes, which is a huge pet peeve of mine with other sleep masks!The quality of my sleep improved in both the short & long term. I fall asleep faster wearing it, and also began to sleep more deeply with less disruption to my sleep cycles."
"This mask is very comfortable, adjustable, and doesn't squish my eyes. I like that the eye cups can be moved around to cater to the individual face shape. It took me a couple of days to get the adjustments correct but now that I have that dialed in it's not slipping off at night at all. When this mask wears out I'll be purchasing another. I do foresee the velcro wearing out before the mask though. When/if this happens I'll just stitch some new velcro to the straps."
"I highly recommend this company. The mask is adjustable, high quality with a thoughtful design. Unfortunately it just doesn't fit my face properly. The eye cups are too round. Amazon doesn't handle the refunds so I contacted Manta Sleep directly. Their refund policy is 60 days and they responded very quickly and politely. The refund was processed the same day it was approved and credited back to my credit card by Amazon. Give it a try, you can't go wrong either way."
"As someone who has never used sleep masks, I wanted this product for the 16 hour flight to Japan. The quality was great and it never came off my head, but I was expecting a little more comfort given the price point I end up returning the product but I'm sure for people who are dependent on sleep, masks for rest, this would be a more than sufficient product. As long as you can make it past the high price point."
"It does what you buy it for - blocks out the light. It uses velcro, so you have to play with the position of the eye cones and with the strap on the back of your head.  Nonetheless, it is a comfortable fit, and it does block out most of the light.  If I continued to play with the eye cones position I could probably get to 100% but the 95% I am experiencing is fine with me.  The bottom line is I am happy with it."
This eye mask is very comfortable and the pads over your eyes are thick and cushioned nicely .. the way the pads are made they form a light barrier around your eyes they don't lay on top of your eyes .. so for all the ladies with extended eyelashes .. this one's for you! The pads have complete coverage no light seeping in anywhere! The material isn't flimsy and it's soft to the touch. Worth every penny!!!! i **** don't put in the dryer if you wash them **** I did and the pads aren't as firm anymore .
"I am a healthcare worker and work night shifts. Pair this mask with Loop ear plugs and I can sleep though anything.This mask does exactly what it says. It blocks all light and is very comfortable. Great quality and doesn't actually look awful. I want to buy the silk cups next.However! The band placement is off, I have to wear the band over the tops of my ears which makes my ears sore the next morning. If I wear it above my ears, I don't get the 100% light blocking."
"My previous sleep mask was not nearly as comfortable as the Manta mask.I've been really happy with it.  The eye pads are thick and lush and give me lots of coverage.The material is soft and comfortable and it makes it easy to wear.I am really glad I went with this mask.  I wear it every night and it hasn't let me down yet.I haven't tried removing the pieces and washing them, but I may do that soon.Go get one and get to sleep!"
This mask does the job  Definitely worth the small investment
"It does a very good job of blocking out all the light. It's much more comfortable than a normal sleep mask, and keeps pressure off your eyes. I love how easy it is to wash too, just toss it in the included laundry bag and wash along with the rest of your laundry.I do find myself waking up to it having slipped off while I was asleep, so I wish it had a little more grip. That's really my only complaint! Overall still a great product."
"I bought 3 masks at the same time to try out and figure out which I'd like best. One got returned, this one I kept but I won't order more. And the third I loved and have ordered extra. This one was ok but not as good as the third. It's fairly soft but it's a bit too firm. If the foam an the eye rings were more squashible I think I'd like it better. It fights a bit for dominance on my face with my cpap mask. I use a nasal mask so it's a bit more forgiving than a full face mask but it's still difficult to find an eye mask that is compatible. This one isn't it. I can see why people love this mask if they don't wear a cpap mask as well though. I can make it work with my cpap but the third mask I got works so much better that this one isn't work the effort."
"Works well, a bit spendy."
