"Go to the gym after you wake up instead of after work, don't drink caffeine after 2am and try go straight to bed after work. Staying up for 4.5hrs after work is a bad idea. 
I worked a similar shift to you. This was my routine: 
\- Wake up at 3pm, eat breakfast, do some chores.
\- Gym at 4.30pm, shower &amp; shave, pack lunch.
\- 6.30pm TV, Coffee &amp; a snack.
\- Work at 8pm.

Are you me? This is pretty close to my schedule lol,
"Magnesium, vitamin D, melatonin.  There is no cookie cutter answer unfortunately.  Find the trigger that wakes you up and try to isolate it.  Having to wake up to piss, less liquid before bed.  Noise is an issue, try ear plugs.  I've been on nights for 19 years and it seems to change from time to time.  Good luck.",
Magnesium was a game changer for me,
"Turn off phone for alerts and notifications, and Activate do not disturb mode. Keep a glass of water by your bed side in case you get thirsty.",
"You need time to adjust. Give it up to a month. 
I suggest, the moment you get home, you have something warm to drink, brush your teeth and lay in bed reading something (If you want to use tablet/phone/kindle enable warm light mode for the device you are using) and just kind of relax and close your eyes and you will drift asleep. 
Wake up around 4pm and do whatever you need to do before you start work. by the time you get home the next day, you will be tired and can fall asleep easily.",
When do you got to gym? Some people find working out too close to bedtime can be too stimulating and disrupt sleep.,
"Yeah, I wouldn’t be able to go after shift, it would wake me up and totally mess me about. I go when I wake up at tea time and that really helps me!",
Give it another 2 week or just 1 week. If none of that work. Time to get a day job.,
Sometimes I drink lavender tea before bed it really helps you sleep,
"The only thing that worked for me was getting off nights, did it for 9mo and couldn’t really adjust.",
kek ive been on midnights for 2 years and take ambien cr now. works great but yeah dependance. i take a 3 day break on my days off and yeah. not great situation.,
"In my experience,  if you are dosing off or napping then you fucked. You need to know what cycle your body is on at the moment. And work from there. If you are in a sleep deficit, just wait till time off and go for a big nap to catch up.
Sleep is for the brain.  Exercising body will not work.",
"Yeah basically alot of what everyone else has said…REALLY important to go to sleep as soon as you get in. I don’t know many people who have a good sleep by waiting a few hours. It’s so important…vitamins, lots of water on the night shift (but try and wean off before 6am, so not peeing all night) , white noise for sleep time, blackout blinds. And good luck! ☺️",
"Get off work, make a small dinner/breakfast, and hit the sheets. Should be up around 3-4PM, then you can hit gym anytime before shift, and you’ll have plenty of daylight to run errands. Been doin night shifts for 4-5 years now it’s all about getting the routine down.

You need to go to bed as early as possible or else your brain will soak up all that morning sun and think it’s time to be awake, which makes it harder to fall asleep in my experience. Going to bed right after the shift helps avoid that a bit, still get some morning light but not for as long.",
"How do you still have energy after working all night?
Are you taking something?",
"Idk, that’s why I posted this. I don’t drink coffee or energy drinks, pretty much just no caffeine in general, and I don’t take melatonin or anything like that for sleep. I think I need to shift my schedule a bit to what people have suggested and wake up earlier/go to sleep earlier, gym before work. Think I’ll make this change next week, I’m pretty good about keeping consistent schedule.",
"Some people just aren't suited to nights, sleeping during the day.

Accept you're gonna have a messed up work/sleep/life or find another job.  There's no other way.",
"i mean, first things first: get a new job that treats you like a human being. 1-2 days off a month? come on",
"Ah i should have mentioned, i work two jobs. One is 5 days per week other is 7 days per MONTH.",
That’s exactly what I was going to say,
Just one day off per MONTH!? Yea that sounds like a violation of labor laws (assuming you’re in the United States).,
My bad i should have mentioned i work two jobs,
"There is no federal law against working that much, they’d have to check their state law",
"Everyone is different in how they are able to manage sleep on days off. Off the top of my head I would suggest on your day off, after finishing at 8am on Saturday, consider taking a shorter recovery nap for about 3-4 hours (till noon or 1pm). This will rejuvenate you enough to spend quality time during daylight hours. Later in the evening, around 8 or 9pm, take another nap for 3-4 hours, waking up around midnight. This way, you'll feel rested enough to work at 11pm on Sunday, and you'll also get the most out of your day off. Everyone's body is different, so you might need to adjust the nap lengths to what feels best for you. Also if you are looking for some more ideas on managing night shift stuff in general, check out our website.",
"I’m confused, you don’t have weekends? Why not?",
"I work two jobs, should have mentioned",
"Aside from potentially the legality of hours, I found sleeping aid tablets like Kalms Night and Nytol helped significantly during my periods of stress during my day job before nights.  These assist putting you into a sleepy mood within 1-2 hours",
"Get a new job. You're slowly dying every day, you will run out of time and regret doing nothing but work.",
"Can you elaborate mate, ive been doing this for about 2 months, i feel ok/great. Im planning on quitting one of the job in January, meaning i will either have 5 night shifts per week of if i feel bad i will switch to day ones. If i feel alright is there any big hidden health issue still?",
I stay up on my 2 day off cycle [7pm - 7am first 'day off I work 7 hours from midnight] but I'm also mentally ill and it can get rough.,
"Black out curtains, sleep mask and a sleep aid. Melatonin doesn't do shit for me.",
I dont think you have read the post,
"I work 10pm till 8am, Mon to Thursday. I'm finishing this morning and about to enter my weekend. 
When i get home knowing I don't have work I get a second wind and all of a sudden don't feel tired. I will literally stay awake till 6 or 7pm on the Friday night and then sleep for 12 solid hours. Therefore, getting up at a normal time on the Saturday morning to spend time with my gf as a day walker. 
I do tend to feel fatigue and tiredness though no matter what I do. 
I just think night shifts, even after 3 years of doing it is just NOT natural for the body.",
"Because it isn't. You/We have been trained and taught that normal sleep time is around ~8pm to 8am. For at least 18 entire years, starting as a baby until or even later than the age of 18 when you can even start working night shifts. It's going to take you way more than 3, 6, 9 or even 20 years by then to ever MAYBE get used to it. I work with people who have been doing this for 20+ years and they're still tired, not used to any of this and only working for the money, fully aware, that in terms of health, night shifts are absolutely counter productive",
"I try to stay up as late as possible when I get home from my last shift(I work 7-7, I try to stay up till one pm) and then I’ll have a little three hour nap and go back to sleep around 11pm and wake up around seven am with my fiancé",
"This sounds like the best plan for me tbf. My partner is an early bird and works a 9-5 job, and he struggles with me working nights. Would be nice to be able to wake up at the same time as him!",
"Yep. Stay up doing laundry, watching tv, have N early supper and have a sleep marathon to get me on track.",
"I stay to my schedule. I used to swap it on my days off, but my sleep is much better if I don’t, so I don’t. I hate being tired all the time. If I stay on schedule I’m not tired all the time.",
My girlfriend has the same shift pattern as you. She doesn't sleep at all until the evening of her first day off unless she is extraordinarily tired. And on her first day back she takes an afternoon nap before work.,
"I am nightowl so I stick with staying up all night, but i'll give an idea cause transitioning back to a ""normal"" schedule for those off days can be pretty tricky. One method for you to try could be ""Sleep Splitting"". After your last night shift, instead of aiming for a solid block of 4-5 hours of sleep, you might try two shorter naps: perhaps a 2-3 hour nap right after work and another 2-hour nap in the late afternoon. This way, you still get rest but might feel more naturally tired by bedtime. We have a tool you can play around with [https://nightowling.com/sleep/](https://nightowling.com/sleep/) for some different ideas pertaining to sleep. All in all, in my experience when I have to try and switch schedules for whatever reason, I seemingly lose at least a day or two of wellbeing somewhere in the switch",
I don’t swap off of night shift schedule unless I have plans that are when I would normally sleep.,
"I used to set an alarm for lunchtime after my last nightshift, then force myself to stay awake and have an early night (around 9pm) that night to get me back into the swing of things.  I ended up groggy the next day.  
Then one day I forgot to set my alarm, woke up naturally about 3pm for a wee and stayed up after that until 10.30pm.  The next day I felt great!  So that's what I do now; sleep until a wee wakes me, usually around 3-3.30pm, then stay up until 10.30-11pm ish.  I feel like my body is telling me what it needs and I feel better listening to it than trying to battle with it.",
"On my last shift I'll get home at 7:30 and sleep till like 10am. It's brutal no lie but I have to force myself to get up. Then I think the biggest help is I go exercise, I play basketball for about 1.5 hours. I'm usually tired enough to then sleep at 9pm or so. But it's definitely a tough transition day",
"the last day of the week is the only day i drink caffeine, it helps me stay awake until like 7-8ish and then i pass out until the next morning. and then after that i just stay up super late when i’m about to go back in for work the following night. it took a lot of tweaking but i got it down sort of haha",
"I have tried to stay awake all day in order to go to sleep at a normal time on the night, but it’s backfired and I’ve ended up being awake until the early hours of the morning instead of being tired. I just can’t seem to crack it 😅",
Melatonin,
"&gt;I currently work 4 12 hour night shifts with 4 days off.
Am I dumb or does that not add up to y'all.",
"I finish at 07:00 on my first ‘rest day’, so technically counts as 4 rest days",
Been trying to figure this one out myself now for a couple years. Have every other weekend off so I’ll go in my last day Thursday night from 6-6am. Get off and try to take a “nap” for only like 3 hours that way I can fall asleep Friday night around midnight or so. Half the time I end up fucking my Friday up and staying up all night and hibernating my whole day off on Saturday. The struggle is real but gotta go where the moneys at unfortunately,
"I’m exactly the same! Staying up or only sleeping for a few hours never works for me as I end up overtired and not sleeping on that night. I do struggle with early starts due to sleep too, but the money is definitely the main pro!",
"Medicate to sleep. Vitamins to stay awake. It’s the only thing that works for me. It’s the only way I feel normal. Otherwise, I’d sleep for four hours at best then be a zombie. I just can’t function.",
what medications/vitamins do you use?,
Unisom (check active ingredient for Doxylamine Succinate as they have several versions). Rainbow Light multivitamin for waking up. Their multivitamins are amazing. Organic and food based.,
"Pretty well, the same as you. And just make sure I have that sense  still feeling minutely tired at least. And am confident I'll be sleeping that night.",
"I pull an all-dayer right after my shift. Instead of going to sleep around 7am, I stay up and don't go to bed until 3pm - 7pm. This hard resets my sleep cycle by staying awake for about 24-28 hours. The first day in the workweek always sucks though because I'm forced to stay up around 24 hours again, unless I can take a nap before but am usually not able to without supplementing more melatonin. I'm on 22 hours without sleep right now, but I'm not tired, but I'm just dead inside, like I always am- but at least I get to see the sun and my family.

TLDR: I am in a state of perpetual exhaustion and melatonin dependency

Edit: Grammar",
"Man, I eventually had to be prescribed trazodone to be able to sleep :/ I developed insomnia and even though I am now a day walker, I still take my meds.",
"That sucks I’m sorry to hear it, pleased it worked for you though. I may have to go down that route if things don’t improve.",
"I did blackout curtains, used cardboard and foam boards to make my room completely dark. I also did eye masks and delta waves sounded. Before that, I actually slept in my closet, on a blow up mattress, cause it was the only place where it got dark enough. It’s okay to get on meds for you to sleep. Like I said, I still take them. Sleep is so fucking important. I understand your frustration. I hope you sleep better soon.",
Dark eye masks.,
"This seems to happens to me when the season changes over. I can’t manage to get more than 4-5 hrs. Just started acting this way 2 weeks ago. Looks like I’m slowly gaining hrs though. 
Then randomly throughout the year it would happen where I wake up after 4 hrs and feel wide awake. I started to just lay there and not open my eyes and next thing you know I’m waking up a couple hours later. Try that. Just lay there and don’t open your eyes but don’t fight it. Just tell yourself you’re gonna lay there for 10 minutes and if after that you’re still awake then get up and try to take that nap a little later. I still do that. Luckily I have no responsibilities that prohibit me from doing so.
Now it’s my inconsiderate cat that wants to be warmer and sleeps on my feet because it’s getting a little colder out.",
"Took me a couple weeks for my body to get used to the night schedule. Now I'm getting about 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. As another comment pointed out, get a good eye mask.",
"It's great that you're already implementing blackout curtains and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The general recommendations first: Considering you're managing your diet and caffeine intake, maintain a consistent sleep schedule even on your days off, if possible. You might also want to explore natural sleep aids like melatonin, but do consult with a healthcare professional first. Reducing screen time an hour before you plan to sleep could help too, but tbh sometimes I feel like having something on distracts me from thinking about and forcing myself to sleep, which ironically leads to falling into a more natural sleep. 
In my experience not being able to stay asleep has to do with stress not allowing you to truly get to ""deep"" sleepiness. Do you think you are potentially over stressed or over stimulated?  If so, try some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, could help. If you continue to struggle, seeking advice from a sleep specialist might be beneficial or work on managing stress.
We are trying to create some tools to help with stuff that night shifters and nightowls more broadly experience. With your current issue you may find [https://nightowling.com/sleep/](https://nightowling.com/sleep/) beneficial. Hope you can get better sleep soon!!!",
"Could be right, I am at a particularly stressful time right now. Thanks for the advice.",
What started working for me is I purchased the Soundcore Sleepbuds and they blocked out day time noise and my sleep has been better recently,
"I didn’t notice but my wife pointed out that at 2:30pm school bus stops outside our apartment and drops off maybe 5 or 6 kids, so that could be an unintended alarm 😅 I’ll look into the sleep buds, thanks!",
Get a headband that has headphones in it. The small speakers cover your ears without being uncomfortable to lay on. They also make them in eye masks if you choose.,
"Do you supplement magnesium? Most people are deficient. It helps you fall asleep and stay asleep between sleep cycles. Look for a supplement that has glycinate, taurate, and malate forms as these are the most bioavailable and beneficial. Take before bed.
Melatonin is helpful when used correctly. Doses are often way too high. A nibble of a kid's chewable is a good place to start (0.5-1mg). Should be taken at around the same time every day, as you are settling into bed, 30 - 60 mins before you want to sleep. 
Also pay attention to your wake time as much as your bed time. Set an alarm and be consistent. If you wake before your alarm, try to stay relaxed in the dark. Pretend it's the middle of the night.",
"So even though you dont have caffeine after midnight, do you have caffeine most days?
Cut it to 0 or almost atleast.
Sleep right after work and be up from idk, 2pm, til you get off work.
Do things that make you busy while you are awake(house work, something productive)
Exercise, workout, tire your body out.
Get vitamin d.",
Yeah I have caffeine every day. I didn’t think to try vitamin D thanks.,
I would recommend dropping caffeine entirely more than anything else. Ever try kickin it?,
"A good eyemask,",
"Melatonin is probably all you need, idk what that sleep aid is but melatonin should be good enough. Hey nothing wrong with the sweater, and a nice set of comfortable PJs, and the AC and black out curtains, I like cranking up the cold and getting under some heavy covers that really helps me sleep. 
Noise cancelling headphones and ear plugs meh that's probably over doing it a bit lol. Might I suggest instead, if you don't live next to a construction site or something, some white noise on a speaker on low volume? There's tons of YouTube videos of 10+ hours of white noise, rain, ocean waves, etc. I'm a truck driver and it's probably pretty weird but if I need help falling asleep I pull up a 10 hour video of semi trucks idling that's some nice background noise for me.
Try not to over do it and make it super complicated. Just some melatonin before bed, a cold room with ac or a fan running, blackout curtains, and some white noise if needed. Also just huh if you need a little extra help falling asleep a little masturbation before bed can definitely help hahahaha, just saying.",
Masturbation is the best sleep aid imo,
"Agreed. Don't need any of that expensive sounding stuff.
Do the business and sleep. Works every time.",
"Agreed. Don't need any of that expensive sounding stuff.

"*60% of the time*, it works ***every*** *time*",
Agreed this is all I need,
A cat.,
we have very different cats then. if i don't shut her out of my bedroom while i'm asleep she'll keep me awake all damn day,
"Same! My cat loves to snuggle under the covers and while it's very endearing and he's actually pretty easy to sleep with as far as cats go, I need to sleep by myself!",
A lot of masterbating and flipping in bed. Maybe trazadone - signed 3rd shifter,
I feel that I get to sleep faster with a weighted blanket,
THANKS! Haven’t thought about that,
Yes!!! I love my weighted blanket. There's a $25 [one](https://www.target.com/p/50-34-x70-34-12lbs-weighted-blanket-gray-room-essentials-8482/-/A-83888835) at Target if you just want to try it out without spending much money.,
"Tried the weighted blanket.
You will get very hot under there.",
"Tried the weighted blanket.
You will get very hot under there.",
I love how they feel but have experienced a couple scary incidents of sleep paralysis while using mine.,
Ancient aliens and some reefer usually do it for me,
White noise! And I also use a humidifier (because I have asthma) and the little bubbling noises that come from that relax me too,
My only recommendations are to be careful with the melatonin as it can be bad for you over a long period of time and maybe pick up a sleeping mask as well. I haven’t slept without mine in a long time now.,
"I used to need a bunch of different things to sleep, until I discovered the eye mask. Holy fuck, game changer. Only bad thing is it smells and needs washed often, and can create some really funny looking bed head.",
i don't even have curtains. just walk into house and sleep.,
A fat blunt,
"For all the folks who wonder if this is ""too much,"" maybe it's more than you want to or need to do, but it might be just the right combination for the OP.
I always struggled to fall asleep and stay asleep. I would toss and turn and generally be miserable. I was pretty nervous about switching to night shift, especially since I'm an early-morning person. I decided I would really get my sleep hygiene in check. Enough activity during the ""day,"" dark, cold cave, weighted blanket, white noise, humidifier in the winter, and microdoses of melatonin only when I absolutely need it. As I cleaned up my other sleep habits, though, I found that I was able to avoid melatonin. Since the beginning of September, I stopped doing my days off back to a day schedule and I started drinking a chamomile/valerian root tea about 45 minutes before bed and taking magnesium glycinate lysinate. I sleep from 09 to 17 every day and I feel so much better.
So yes - test out sleep aids that you think will help and find out what works for you. I know I spent a bit of money readying my room for optimal sleep, but it's so, so worth it. Plus, with that shift diff, who cares?!! 😂",
"This is a joke, right?",
I wish it was,
Either you're overdoing it or nightshift isn't for you 🤷,
Not everybody adjusts like you have. It’s taken me months to get used to it.,
It's not exactly easy for me but since op listed practically *every possible* option (when usually one or 2 works for most people) I  wasnt sure if they were serious 🤷‍♂️,
"Why do you need any of this? Just close your blinds and go to sleep like you would normally at night. The more you overcomplicate the simple process of sleep, the more counterproductive it will bite you in the ass later. 
You don't need blue light glasses. Your body will adapt and can handle the few minutes or extra hours before you go to sleep. Also: blue light filtered glasses have been increasingly declared useless by recent medical studies because they offer absolutely no provable benefits or evidence of actually doing anything.
You don't need sleep earplugs or headphones because you'll be so tired in the beginning phase that not even a siren will wake you up. After you've adjusted, you'll sleep as deep as you normally would in the night time on a normal schedule. Also: ears need space and air. Having them covered up/closed for 8 hours isn't healthy and can lead to medical problems.
You don't need sleeping aids because most of them are pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo. 
And you don't need meds unless a doctor specifically  said you do because your body can't handle itself. Otherwise you're just getting addicted or wasting money on something you neither need nor should use to begin with. Don't train your body that good sleep is only something that can be accomplished with 50 gadgets and preparations. It's not biologically natural, healthy and will absolutely bite you in the ass in your later life by leading to actual insomnia should you ever eventually return back to a ""normal"" life.

You generally seem to have fallen into the rabbit hole of everything pseudo-scientific in terms of sleep. 90% of these (medical) gadgets/items have 0 effect, are non-essential, not required and only exist to sell stuff to people who think any of it helps.",
"Most of what you just said isnt evidence based either lol. ""Just close your blinds and go to sleep"" is not useful advice for people who are wired when they get home from a crazy shift",
"[melatonin](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/well/mind/melatonin-sleep-insomnia.html)
Regarding the use of Melatonin unless specifically described by a doctor. 
If you close your blinds, you don't need eye masks because those are only intended for environments where there is no chance of darkening it.
[blue filtered glasses](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/wellness/2023/07/03/do-blue-light-glasses-work/70307265007/)
Regarding blue filtered glasses. It's just another marketing scheme. If it was backed by science, then global medical facilities, eye doctors and insurances would support the use and prescription of those glasses, which they don't.
[ear muffs](https://www.healthline.com/health/sleeping-with-earplugs#side-effects)
Regarding ear muffs etc. that lead to your ear wax being stuck or even pushed back into your ear, causing health damage. Same logic as the eye blinds: unless you're sleeping near a highway or on an airport, your body doesn't need additional protection to help keep loud sounds out.


If you wanna talk shit about me not providing evidence, maybe provide some evidence of your own to counter-point instead of spewing medical BS that can lead to people developing health problems just because you wanna feel like an internet big boy and are encouraging their toxic health behaviour, that is often times an overreaction. Unlike you, I've consulted medical experts on how to handle night shifts, and they all confirmed what you can read in the evidence selection I posted above.

Working a ""crazy shift"" is sure as hell not going to get any better if you oversensitivize your body and system with overreactive measures, medicine and whatever else mumbo jumbo people still believe in nowadays. Again: nobody should take any supplements, medicine, drugs or other stuff unless prior medical consultation that CONFIRMS that you NEED to.",
Do you wear your headphones on top of earplugs ?,
"Damn lol
I legit have nothing of what you just named except AC and sleep just fine.",
Headband headphones.,
I work 1 week in 4 nights and if it wasn’t for promethazine ie phenergan (U.K.) I couldn’t do it,
Pillow?,
Blue light filters on all leds,
The jog or bike rides before bed so you feel physically tired,
"No, the complete opposite. This weekend I messed up my sleeping schedule and slept all three nights , best fucking sleep I've had in a long ass time. 
Slept like 7-9 hours each night and woke up refreshed and rejuvenated, not the least groggy and felt like I could tackle the day. Sleep felt so natural.",
"
Melatonin helped me",
I had to go to days for a month. My sleep was messed up. I'd sleep for 12 hours then nap during the day then be exhausted for 10pm again. I switched back to nights and went right back to my 8 hour routine without much of an adjustment period. Maybe microdose some melatonin. I hope your sleep improves.,
"yes, but it was always temporary, longest was maybe 2 months.  I could never get into a ""normal"" schedule.  I would still fall asleep as soon as I was off work, then wake up at like 2am ready to start my day.",
"Yeah I do worse on days, definitely have a harder time sleeping.",
It always took me awhile to get used to days when I would do rotating shifts since I could never sleep the night before. Now that I permanently work 6am-230pm it's nice because I usually go to bed when it gets dark now and sleep much better. In the summer I was literally going to bed just after sunset and waking up around 430-5 am when the sun was rising.,
Are you depressed? I am and I'm chronically tired no matter what,
Nope.  It's the normal and optimal way to go about things.  If you're having trouble sleeping at nights I would suggest seeing your doctor.,
"in september i worked 14 nights in 18 days, then got a 2-week day off. those two weeks were the ugliest sleep of my life. i tried different melatonin but nothing worked. what worked? i started working more am and pm shift than night shift.",
I put a request in for a day shift mainly to protect myself from being fired. It'll be the first time in years that I will work during the day,
When I get fired I would let you know.,
"I think a large part of getting used to days is going to bed early and getting plenty of sleep. 
Pretty hard in our society actually. 
Get a SAD lamp and set it go off a few minutes before your alarm. I would read the news/Reddit during those minutes. 
Also, melatonin for first week to help reset your circadian rhythm;  stretching/relaxed range of motion exercises about an hour or two before bed; hot bath or shower just prior to bed; alcohol &amp; nicotine will worsen quality sleep.",
"Before 11pm - 7 am. Sleep was bad. It just felt like two - three naps. It was enough but never quality. Loved no traffic. Shopping for groceries at 8 am. 
Moved to 3pm - 11:30 pm. I can’t sleep when I get home. I’m up to 4-5 am. I wake up at before noon though, like before. 
I want to go sleep right away. I just can’t. Always been a night owl but night shift really cooked me. 
I tried melatonin when I was on nights. I hated waking up all groggy. My body wouldn’t feel “awake” until I got to work. lol",
"Yes. It’s been two years and it’s gotten a little better. Now I can usually fall asleep at 1am but for the first 1.5 years after nights I was unable to fall asleep before 4am despite having to be up at 5/6am.
I’m still trying to find solutions myself with the help of my doctor but so far having a strict bedtime routine has done the most help. The usual no phones or bright lights, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, pretty much the same things we preach to those starting out on nights and needing to sleep during the day. 
My big issue was getting my brain to turn off at night. I feel so much more productive from 12am-4am so my doctor prescribed an anti anxiety medication for me to use before bed. I don’t have anxiety at night but it has helped a tiny bit to get my brain to chill. 

I highly recommend seeing a doctor, I feel like the sooner you tackle the issue the better.",
"Yes! I can only sleep between 4am and 4pm. The overnight shift was perfect. Now am on days, 2-10pm, and it's horrible. Sleeping right up until having to leave for work has me in a funk.",
I am the opposite tbh i prefer day shifts nights play havoc with my anxiety 99% of the time,
"My roster is 2 days 2 nights 5 off, 2 days 3 nights 4 off, 3 days 2 nights 5 off, all 6-6 shifts. I sleep much better during the day in between nights than at night but my sleep schedule is non existent",
"Yes, but I'm a nightowl so was to be expected. No matter how much I slept on a ""normal"" schedule I was always tired during the day and energetic at night. No surprise I always shifted back to my nightowl sleep schedule",
I think it just depends on the individual. Some people are simply night owls. I'm the same way I sleep better during the day then at night usually. Needless to say school sucked for me 😆. I did take sleep medication as a child for insomnia so sleep in general can be tough for me but yeah for some reason my insomnia is worse on dayshift then nightshift,
I did I had to start smoking weed to help me sleep,

i sleep as soon as i get home (7a) then get up at 2p-3p so i can do stuff during the day,
Work 7p to 7:30a. Sleep 10a to 5p (ideally). On days off sleep 5a to 1p.,
"VERY similar to me.
Work 7:00pm to 7:00am
Sleep day on 9:30am to 3:30pm
Sleep first day off 9:30am to 6:00pm (catchup on sleep)
Sleep day off 6:00am to 2:00pm",
I commute by bike so good exercise is worked into my daily routine.,
"If I have several nights in a row, I get off at 7 am, and stay in bed from 9-5. I don’t have to sleep those 8 hours, but I make myself stay in bed. Up at 5, do random shit around the house, back to work for 7pm.",
Exercise and meal prep.,
I eat all my  meals at work so I don’t snack on junk. I keep the same sleep schedule regardless of day so I sleep well. I run or workout before work most days. Sleep 6-7 hours a night (day),
"I get off work around 8:00. Do normal people stuff until 13:00 (try to squeeze in some exercise too) then start to wind down. I sleep at 14:30. 
I don’t eat overnight. My first meal is at 6:00, last meal is 12:00. Been a year in night shift now and I can honestly say that I have adjusted well.",
6p or 6a?,
6a,
"I work 10pm to 6am, leave work and go to the gym, then sleep from 9am to 5pm.
I also don’t eat that much at night. I have dinner with my family at about 5:30/6pm, then have a snack, like an apple, granola bar or yogurt every couple hours. When I get home, I have a small meal, usually leftover dinner or cereal.
I’ve been on nights consistently for a year and that’s what worked best for me!",
"As few sweets as i can resist, only water and no eating after 12 at night until breakfast next day. Walk to work and back (instead of bike/train/bus), enough sleep.",
Watching what I eat and how frequently I eat. I work 6-6.,
"I get two unpaid 30’s and two paid 15’s on my 12 hour shift, try to walk laps around the parking lot during all of them. i try to eat low carb/atkins and avoid snacking. I also try to do weights three days a week and an hour on the exercise bike three days a week. I work 7 on 7 off essentially. Exercise is easier on the off days and diet is easier on the work days, but I try for both on both.",
"Proper sleep, meal prep, and regular exercise.",
"I work 2215-0645, eat at 1930 (with my family) 2330 and 0200. A sandwich, chips, cookies, yogurt and a fruit. I never really vary this. Also drink 2 liters of water from the time I get up, to the end of my shift. I take a fiber supplement, 1000iu vitamin d, and 250mg vitamin c. Get home by 0725 eat eggs with veggies. In bed by 0830, and try to sleep until 1530-1600. I've been doing this for 5 years now. That's always worked decently (I say decently because nothing is perfect on these overnights). In fact, lately, I feel wide awake all the time, not in a good way. Like when I used to get off worked I could barely keep my eyes open. Now I'm ready to go and do yard work, stay up with kids, read etc. Anyone experience this after 5+ years on overnights?",
"I make sure I get 8-10 hrs of sleep a day.
Edit: day, not night.",
"I sleep from 830 am until 3 pm. I have an hour commute so I go immediately to bed, wear dark sunglasses for the ride. I take a melatonin 30 min into my ride home. I sleep for 6-7 hours and travel back one hour. On days off I arrive home and sleep about 4-5 hours and then go to bed later with my family so my routine is not off with the night time sleeping hours. 
I have been on this job for 5 years. My exercise and eating habits mirror many of the ones here, careful not to eat only a healthy snack at work. Caffeine is one cup when I wake up.",
"Stay away from fried food and sweets. Water only (no soda, even diet/caffeine free, no energy drinks) and exercise when you can",
"Just flip your schedule around. Working nights doesn’t make you less healthy…? I still get my 2 workouts in a day and my diet stays the same, it’s a bit weird eating dinner in the morning but it is what it is. Just flip your schedule around, if you have a healthy diet and habits then there shouldn’t be any problems with working nights, just some getting used to.",
Some of us don't have the luxury of seeing the light of day especially in the winter during work week. So there's that too. Vitamin d helps. You lose protein in your blood and shit and metabolism slows down. Im stuck inside from 8pm to 9am meaning I only see light of day driving to and from work,
"I sleep 7 hours a day. I go to bed within two hours of getting off work. I wear blue light blocking glasses upon leaving work in order for my body to produce natural melatonin so that I will get good quality sleep and fall asleep naturally. I also do OMAD (one meal a day) and I don't eat anytime after 8pm. The later into the evening you eat, the more trouble your body has digesting that food and spiking your blood sugar levels. I also do a keto type diet with very low carb and sugar intake. Night shift affects the bodies ability to process sugars and carbs. Can lead to higher blood sugar and cause issues with insulin resistance. Right now, I am at the healthiest I've ever been in my life. On day shift I was overweight and low energy and living on caffeine. I am none of those things now.",
"I've done various things... so I work 10 PM - 8 AM.  I used to go on a bike ride for an hour during my lunch break but biking at night isn't very interesting... so I switched to taking walks  in our local state forest for an hour (it's like 10 min from my house) after work.  I've been slacking on the weekend bike rides though.
I sleep from about 12 noon until 9 PM or so.  Working from home and not having to commute an hour to and an hour from work has helped.",
"I Work from 9:30 to 7:30 I sleep from 8-4 I walk 4km 90% of days by Walking on my breaks at work and walking in the evening before work. I work from home and my street is a 390m loop so I do 10 loops and get 3.9k   
I've been on night shift for 11 years now and its WONDERFUL... BEST THING I EVER CHOSE TO DO!!",
Only eat 2 nutri grain bars during my shift. Then 2 more for the ride home and a protien shake. Then wake up and drink a shake a have a bar. Go to the gym. Eat dinner. Repeat,
5-10 min walk every hour,
I take a really good multivitamin at the beginning of my shift. I take an organic food based one from Rainbow Light.,
"What's the brand multivitamin you use? I want to start taking them regularly, but theres a million to choose from",
Rainbow Light. You can find them on Amazon,
"I work 11pm-7am. Before work at 7pm I work out, then I cook dinner after to eat before work and to also have a meal for lunch. After work I cook breakfast then sleep like a baby.",
Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Exercise and eat healthy. Same things you should do if you were day shift. But you must make them way more of a priority because night shift is already hard on the body.,
"I can't sleep as soon as I go home. I have to unwind and do stuff. I get all my chores and shopping done in the morning. I'll usually workout as soon as I get off or go for a bike ride then do the other stuff eat. Relax by watching a movie or a show then go to bed by about 10am usually. 

I work 7:15p.m to 4-6am depending on overtime and such",
Stay healthy? 😓,
Y’all are healthy???,
"It's the same as working days, but at different times?",
"If I fall into a 'day schedule' on my weekends...I always go for a nap Saturday night until 12am-1a. Then stay up all night to sleep for Sunday night shift. 
Typically sleep 1pm - 9pm give or take an hour or 2. (I work 11-7)",
Swing shifts should be illegal or have way more pay and time off imo. Good luck.,
Agreed but just one night at least!,
Quit that job if you value your life.,
"After your 7am-3pm shift, try to stay awake as long as possible, ideally until around 8 or 9pm. Then take a short nap (3-4 hours). Wake up around midnight or 1am and stay awake until after your night shift ends at 7am. This will help reset your internal clock more quickly. After your night shift, head home, create a dark and quiet sleeping environment, and aim to sleep as long as your body will let you, ideally until around 3 or 4pm. This will set you up better for the subsequent night shifts. Everyone's body reacts differently, so listen to your body and adjust as needed.",
Thank you!!! That sounds like a good plan. I was thinking of trying something like that. :),
One nap at a time. This is the way (of the nightshifter),
"It”s one dayshift for orientation. I understand that. I work in the medical field. My go to every single day/night routine is Unisom to sleep, Rainbow Light organic multivitamin and coffee to be awake.  I cannot sleep without a sleep aid. I have screwed up my circadian rhythm so bad with my years and years shift work. It’s the only thing that works for me.",
Thankyou :) I’m also in the medical field. Ill look into those!,
"When I pick up my Unisom, look for the one with the active ingredient Doxycycline Succinate. Not the one with the same active ingredient as Benadryl. That gives me a hangover when I wake up and takes too long to shake off.",
you don't.,
"A few supplements you can take an hour before bed that are helpful are Glycine, magnesium l-threonate and Apigenin.",
I will try them.  Thx,
"I think you’re fully acclimated to night shift now. If you’ve been changing your schedule on the weekends, you never really got into a real sleep rhythm, and slowly but surely, you eventually did anyways. I work very similar hours as your and used to change my weekend hours by 4 hours so I could be up and at it by noon, but now I can’t really do that anymore, I can’t fall asleep for shit that early now. 
Anyways, that’s totally a guess as to why you can’t sleep. I can’t even change mine by a few hours anymore.",
Edit: my shift hours are 21:30-07:30,
"Could it be the change of the seasons and the sun setting earlier? Because I remember having trouble getting sleep this time last year and I’m dealing with it again. Going on like 3 weeks. I’ll go to bed around 10 and no matter what I’m waking up around 2-3pm. I also suspect my place is low on humidity now that I’ve gotta fire up the furnace and drying the place up. 
But I don’t do what you do regarding the days off, I keep the same sleep schedule all week. Maybe you’re just getting old",
😂 maybe I am,
,"Go to the gym after you wake up instead of after work, don't drink caffeine after 2am and try go straight to bed after work. Staying up for 4.5hrs after work is a bad idea. 

I worked a similar shift to you. This was my routine: 

\- Wake up at 3pm, eat breakfast, do some chores.

\- Gym at 4.30pm, shower &amp; shave, pack lunch.

\- 6.30pm TV, Coffee &amp; a snack.

\- Work at 8pm.

\- Lunch &amp; Coffee at 11pm.

\- Dinner at 3am.

\- Bed at 7.30am."
,Are you me? This is pretty close to my schedule lol
,"Magnesium, vitamin D, melatonin.  There is no cookie cutter answer unfortunately.  Find the trigger that wakes you up and try to isolate it.  Having to wake up to piss, less liquid before bed.  Noise is an issue, try ear plugs.  I've been on nights for 19 years and it seems to change from time to time.  Good luck."
,Magnesium was a game changer for me
,"Turn off phone for alerts and notifications, and Activate do not disturb mode. Keep a glass of water by your bed side in case you get thirsty."
,"You need time to adjust. Give it up to a month. 

I suggest, the moment you get home, you have something warm to drink, brush your teeth and lay in bed reading something (If you want to use tablet/phone/kindle enable warm light mode for the device you are using) and just kind of relax and close your eyes and you will drift asleep. 

Wake up around 4pm and do whatever you need to do before you start work. by the time you get home the next day, you will be tired and can fall asleep easily."
,When do you got to gym? Some people find working out too close to bedtime can be too stimulating and disrupt sleep.
,"Yeah, I wouldn’t be able to go after shift, it would wake me up and totally mess me about. I go when I wake up at tea time and that really helps me!"
,Give it another 2 week or just 1 week. If none of that work. Time to get a day job.
,Sometimes I drink lavender tea before bed it really helps you sleep
,"The only thing that worked for me was getting off nights, did it for 9mo and couldn’t really adjust."
,kek ive been on midnights for 2 years and take ambien cr now. works great but yeah dependance. i take a 3 day break on my days off and yeah. not great situation.
,"In my experience,  if you are dosing off or napping then you fucked. You need to know what cycle your body is on at the moment. And work from there. If you are in a sleep deficit, just wait till time off and go for a big nap to catch up.

Sleep is for the brain.  Exercising body will not work."
,"Yeah basically alot of what everyone else has said…REALLY important to go to sleep as soon as you get in. I don’t know many people who have a good sleep by waiting a few hours. It’s so important…vitamins, lots of water on the night shift (but try and wean off before 6am, so not peeing all night) , white noise for sleep time, blackout blinds. And good luck! ☺️"
,"Get off work, make a small dinner/breakfast, and hit the sheets. Should be up around 3-4PM, then you can hit gym anytime before shift, and you’ll have plenty of daylight to run errands. Been doin night shifts for 4-5 years now it’s all about getting the routine down.

You need to go to bed as early as possible or else your brain will soak up all that morning sun and think it’s time to be awake, which makes it harder to fall asleep in my experience. Going to bed right after the shift helps avoid that a bit, still get some morning light but not for as long."
,"How do you still have energy after working all night?
Are you taking something?"
,"Idk, that’s why I posted this. I don’t drink coffee or energy drinks, pretty much just no caffeine in general, and I don’t take melatonin or anything like that for sleep. I think I need to shift my schedule a bit to what people have suggested and wake up earlier/go to sleep earlier, gym before work. Think I’ll make this change next week, I’m pretty good about keeping consistent schedule."
,"Some people just aren't suited to nights, sleeping during the day.

Accept you're gonna have a messed up work/sleep/life or find another job.  There's no other way."
,"i mean, first things first: get a new job that treats you like a human being. 1-2 days off a month? come on"
,"Ah i should have mentioned, i work two jobs. One is 5 days per week other is 7 days per MONTH."
,That’s exactly what I was going to say
,Just one day off per MONTH!? Yea that sounds like a violation of labor laws (assuming you’re in the United States).
,My bad i should have mentioned i work two jobs
,"There is no federal law against working that much, they’d have to check their state law"
,"Everyone is different in how they are able to manage sleep on days off. Off the top of my head I would suggest on your day off, after finishing at 8am on Saturday, consider taking a shorter recovery nap for about 3-4 hours (till noon or 1pm). This will rejuvenate you enough to spend quality time during daylight hours. Later in the evening, around 8 or 9pm, take another nap for 3-4 hours, waking up around midnight. This way, you'll feel rested enough to work at 11pm on Sunday, and you'll also get the most out of your day off. Everyone's body is different, so you might need to adjust the nap lengths to what feels best for you. Also if you are looking for some more ideas on managing night shift stuff in general, check out our website."
,"I’m confused, you don’t have weekends? Why not?"
,"I work two jobs, should have mentioned"
,"Aside from potentially the legality of hours, I found sleeping aid tablets like Kalms Night and Nytol helped significantly during my periods of stress during my day job before nights.  These assist putting you into a sleepy mood within 1-2 hours"
,"Get a new job. You're slowly dying every day, you will run out of time and regret doing nothing but work."
,"Can you elaborate mate, ive been doing this for about 2 months, i feel ok/great. Im planning on quitting one of the job in January, meaning i will either have 5 night shifts per week of if i feel bad i will switch to day ones. If i feel alright is there any big hidden health issue still?"
,I stay up on my 2 day off cycle [7pm - 7am first 'day off I work 7 hours from midnight] but I'm also mentally ill and it can get rough.
,"Black out curtains, sleep mask and a sleep aid. Melatonin doesn't do shit for me."
,I dont think you have read the post
,"I work 10pm till 8am, Mon to Thursday. I'm finishing this morning and about to enter my weekend. 

When i get home knowing I don't have work I get a second wind and all of a sudden don't feel tired. I will literally stay awake till 6 or 7pm on the Friday night and then sleep for 12 solid hours. Therefore, getting up at a normal time on the Saturday morning to spend time with my gf as a day walker. 

I do tend to feel fatigue and tiredness though no matter what I do. 

I just think night shifts, even after 3 years of doing it is just NOT natural for the body."
,"Because it isn't. You/We have been trained and taught that normal sleep time is around ~8pm to 8am. For at least 18 entire years, starting as a baby until or even later than the age of 18 when you can even start working night shifts. It's going to take you way more than 3, 6, 9 or even 20 years by then to ever MAYBE get used to it. I work with people who have been doing this for 20+ years and they're still tired, not used to any of this and only working for the money, fully aware, that in terms of health, night shifts are absolutely counter productive"
,"I try to stay up as late as possible when I get home from my last shift(I work 7-7, I try to stay up till one pm) and then I’ll have a little three hour nap and go back to sleep around 11pm and wake up around seven am with my fiancé"
,"This sounds like the best plan for me tbf. My partner is an early bird and works a 9-5 job, and he struggles with me working nights. Would be nice to be able to wake up at the same time as him!"
,"Yep. Stay up doing laundry, watching tv, have N early supper and have a sleep marathon to get me on track."
,"I stay to my schedule. I used to swap it on my days off, but my sleep is much better if I don’t, so I don’t. I hate being tired all the time. If I stay on schedule I’m not tired all the time."
,My girlfriend has the same shift pattern as you. She doesn't sleep at all until the evening of her first day off unless she is extraordinarily tired. And on her first day back she takes an afternoon nap before work.
,"I am nightowl so I stick with staying up all night, but i'll give an idea cause transitioning back to a ""normal"" schedule for those off days can be pretty tricky. One method for you to try could be ""Sleep Splitting"". After your last night shift, instead of aiming for a solid block of 4-5 hours of sleep, you might try two shorter naps: perhaps a 2-3 hour nap right after work and another 2-hour nap in the late afternoon. This way, you still get rest but might feel more naturally tired by bedtime. We have a tool you can play around with [https://nightowling.com/sleep/](https://nightowling.com/sleep/) for some different ideas pertaining to sleep. All in all, in my experience when I have to try and switch schedules for whatever reason, I seemingly lose at least a day or two of wellbeing somewhere in the switch"
,I don’t swap off of night shift schedule unless I have plans that are when I would normally sleep.
,"I used to set an alarm for lunchtime after my last nightshift, then force myself to stay awake and have an early night (around 9pm) that night to get me back into the swing of things.  I ended up groggy the next day.  

Then one day I forgot to set my alarm, woke up naturally about 3pm for a wee and stayed up after that until 10.30pm.  The next day I felt great!  So that's what I do now; sleep until a wee wakes me, usually around 3-3.30pm, then stay up until 10.30-11pm ish.  I feel like my body is telling me what it needs and I feel better listening to it than trying to battle with it."
,"On my last shift I'll get home at 7:30 and sleep till like 10am. It's brutal no lie but I have to force myself to get up. Then I think the biggest help is I go exercise, I play basketball for about 1.5 hours. I'm usually tired enough to then sleep at 9pm or so. But it's definitely a tough transition day"
,"the last day of the week is the only day i drink caffeine, it helps me stay awake until like 7-8ish and then i pass out until the next morning. and then after that i just stay up super late when i’m about to go back in for work the following night. it took a lot of tweaking but i got it down sort of haha"
,"I have tried to stay awake all day in order to go to sleep at a normal time on the night, but it’s backfired and I’ve ended up being awake until the early hours of the morning instead of being tired. I just can’t seem to crack it 😅"
,Melatonin
,"&gt;I currently work 4 12 hour night shifts with 4 days off.

Am I dumb or does that not add up to y'all."
,"I finish at 07:00 on my first ‘rest day’, so technically counts as 4 rest days"
,Been trying to figure this one out myself now for a couple years. Have every other weekend off so I’ll go in my last day Thursday night from 6-6am. Get off and try to take a “nap” for only like 3 hours that way I can fall asleep Friday night around midnight or so. Half the time I end up fucking my Friday up and staying up all night and hibernating my whole day off on Saturday. The struggle is real but gotta go where the moneys at unfortunately
,"I’m exactly the same! Staying up or only sleeping for a few hours never works for me as I end up overtired and not sleeping on that night. I do struggle with early starts due to sleep too, but the money is definitely the main pro!"
,"Medicate to sleep. Vitamins to stay awake. It’s the only thing that works for me. It’s the only way I feel normal. Otherwise, I’d sleep for four hours at best then be a zombie. I just can’t function."
,what medications/vitamins do you use?
,Unisom (check active ingredient for Doxylamine Succinate as they have several versions). Rainbow Light multivitamin for waking up. Their multivitamins are amazing. Organic and food based.
,"Pretty well, the same as you. And just make sure I have that sense  still feeling minutely tired at least. And am confident I'll be sleeping that night."
,"I pull an all-dayer right after my shift. Instead of going to sleep around 7am, I stay up and don't go to bed until 3pm - 7pm. This hard resets my sleep cycle by staying awake for about 24-28 hours. The first day in the workweek always sucks though because I'm forced to stay up around 24 hours again, unless I can take a nap before but am usually not able to without supplementing more melatonin. I'm on 22 hours without sleep right now, but I'm not tired, but I'm just dead inside, like I always am- but at least I get to see the sun and my family.

TLDR: I am in a state of perpetual exhaustion and melatonin dependency

Edit: Grammar"
,"Man, I eventually had to be prescribed trazodone to be able to sleep :/ I developed insomnia and even though I am now a day walker, I still take my meds."
,"That sucks I’m sorry to hear it, pleased it worked for you though. I may have to go down that route if things don’t improve."
,"I did blackout curtains, used cardboard and foam boards to make my room completely dark. I also did eye masks and delta waves sounded. Before that, I actually slept in my closet, on a blow up mattress, cause it was the only place where it got dark enough. It’s okay to get on meds for you to sleep. Like I said, I still take them. Sleep is so fucking important. I understand your frustration. I hope you sleep better soon."
,Dark eye masks.
,"This seems to happens to me when the season changes over. I can’t manage to get more than 4-5 hrs. Just started acting this way 2 weeks ago. Looks like I’m slowly gaining hrs though. 

Then randomly throughout the year it would happen where I wake up after 4 hrs and feel wide awake. I started to just lay there and not open my eyes and next thing you know I’m waking up a couple hours later. Try that. Just lay there and don’t open your eyes but don’t fight it. Just tell yourself you’re gonna lay there for 10 minutes and if after that you’re still awake then get up and try to take that nap a little later. I still do that. Luckily I have no responsibilities that prohibit me from doing so.

Now it’s my inconsiderate cat that wants to be warmer and sleeps on my feet because it’s getting a little colder out."
,"Took me a couple weeks for my body to get used to the night schedule. Now I'm getting about 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. As another comment pointed out, get a good eye mask."
,"It's great that you're already implementing blackout curtains and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The general recommendations first: Considering you're managing your diet and caffeine intake, maintain a consistent sleep schedule even on your days off, if possible. You might also want to explore natural sleep aids like melatonin, but do consult with a healthcare professional first. Reducing screen time an hour before you plan to sleep could help too, but tbh sometimes I feel like having something on distracts me from thinking about and forcing myself to sleep, which ironically leads to falling into a more natural sleep. 

In my experience not being able to stay asleep has to do with stress not allowing you to truly get to ""deep"" sleepiness. Do you think you are potentially over stressed or over stimulated?  If so, try some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, could help. If you continue to struggle, seeking advice from a sleep specialist might be beneficial or work on managing stress.

We are trying to create some tools to help with stuff that night shifters and nightowls more broadly experience. With your current issue you may find [https://nightowling.com/sleep/](https://nightowling.com/sleep/) beneficial. Hope you can get better sleep soon!!!"
,"Could be right, I am at a particularly stressful time right now. Thanks for the advice."
,What started working for me is I purchased the Soundcore Sleepbuds and they blocked out day time noise and my sleep has been better recently
,"I didn’t notice but my wife pointed out that at 2:30pm school bus stops outside our apartment and drops off maybe 5 or 6 kids, so that could be an unintended alarm 😅 I’ll look into the sleep buds, thanks!"
,Get a headband that has headphones in it. The small speakers cover your ears without being uncomfortable to lay on. They also make them in eye masks if you choose.
,"Do you supplement magnesium? Most people are deficient. It helps you fall asleep and stay asleep between sleep cycles. Look for a supplement that has glycinate, taurate, and malate forms as these are the most bioavailable and beneficial. Take before bed.

Melatonin is helpful when used correctly. Doses are often way too high. A nibble of a kid's chewable is a good place to start (0.5-1mg). Should be taken at around the same time every day, as you are settling into bed, 30 - 60 mins before you want to sleep. 

Also pay attention to your wake time as much as your bed time. Set an alarm and be consistent. If you wake before your alarm, try to stay relaxed in the dark. Pretend it's the middle of the night."
,"So even though you dont have caffeine after midnight, do you have caffeine most days?
Cut it to 0 or almost atleast.
Sleep right after work and be up from idk, 2pm, til you get off work.
Do things that make you busy while you are awake(house work, something productive)
Exercise, workout, tire your body out.
Get vitamin d."
,Yeah I have caffeine every day. I didn’t think to try vitamin D thanks.
,I would recommend dropping caffeine entirely more than anything else. Ever try kickin it?
,"A good eyemask,"
,"Melatonin is probably all you need, idk what that sleep aid is but melatonin should be good enough. Hey nothing wrong with the sweater, and a nice set of comfortable PJs, and the AC and black out curtains, I like cranking up the cold and getting under some heavy covers that really helps me sleep. 

Noise cancelling headphones and ear plugs meh that's probably over doing it a bit lol. Might I suggest instead, if you don't live next to a construction site or something, some white noise on a speaker on low volume? There's tons of YouTube videos of 10+ hours of white noise, rain, ocean waves, etc. I'm a truck driver and it's probably pretty weird but if I need help falling asleep I pull up a 10 hour video of semi trucks idling that's some nice background noise for me.

Try not to over do it and make it super complicated. Just some melatonin before bed, a cold room with ac or a fan running, blackout curtains, and some white noise if needed. Also just huh if you need a little extra help falling asleep a little masturbation before bed can definitely help hahahaha, just saying."
,Masturbation is the best sleep aid imo
,"Agreed. Don't need any of that expensive sounding stuff.
Do the business and sleep. Works every time."
,"Agreed. Don't need any of that expensive sounding stuff.
Do the business and sleep. Works every time."
,"*60% of the time*, it works ***every*** *time*"
,Agreed this is all I need
,A cat.
,we have very different cats then. if i don't shut her out of my bedroom while i'm asleep she'll keep me awake all damn day
,"Same! My cat loves to snuggle under the covers and while it's very endearing and he's actually pretty easy to sleep with as far as cats go, I need to sleep by myself!"
,A lot of masterbating and flipping in bed. Maybe trazadone - signed 3rd shifter
,I feel that I get to sleep faster with a weighted blanket
,THANKS! Haven’t thought about that
,Yes!!! I love my weighted blanket. There's a $25 [one](https://www.target.com/p/50-34-x70-34-12lbs-weighted-blanket-gray-room-essentials-8482/-/A-83888835) at Target if you just want to try it out without spending much money.
,"Tried the weighted blanket.
You will get very hot under there."
,"Tried the weighted blanket.
You will get very hot under there."
,I love how they feel but have experienced a couple scary incidents of sleep paralysis while using mine.
,Ancient aliens and some reefer usually do it for me
,White noise! And I also use a humidifier (because I have asthma) and the little bubbling noises that come from that relax me too
,My only recommendations are to be careful with the melatonin as it can be bad for you over a long period of time and maybe pick up a sleeping mask as well. I haven’t slept without mine in a long time now.
,"I used to need a bunch of different things to sleep, until I discovered the eye mask. Holy fuck, game changer. Only bad thing is it smells and needs washed often, and can create some really funny looking bed head."
,i don't even have curtains. just walk into house and sleep.
,A fat blunt
,"For all the folks who wonder if this is ""too much,"" maybe it's more than you want to or need to do, but it might be just the right combination for the OP.

I always struggled to fall asleep and stay asleep. I would toss and turn and generally be miserable. I was pretty nervous about switching to night shift, especially since I'm an early-morning person. I decided I would really get my sleep hygiene in check. Enough activity during the ""day,"" dark, cold cave, weighted blanket, white noise, humidifier in the winter, and microdoses of melatonin only when I absolutely need it. As I cleaned up my other sleep habits, though, I found that I was able to avoid melatonin. Since the beginning of September, I stopped doing my days off back to a day schedule and I started drinking a chamomile/valerian root tea about 45 minutes before bed and taking magnesium glycinate lysinate. I sleep from 09 to 17 every day and I feel so much better.

So yes - test out sleep aids that you think will help and find out what works for you. I know I spent a bit of money readying my room for optimal sleep, but it's so, so worth it. Plus, with that shift diff, who cares?!! 😂"
,"This is a joke, right?"
,I wish it was
,Either you're overdoing it or nightshift isn't for you 🤷
,Not everybody adjusts like you have. It’s taken me months to get used to it.
,It's not exactly easy for me but since op listed practically *every possible* option (when usually one or 2 works for most people) I  wasnt sure if they were serious 🤷‍♂️
,"Why do you need any of this? Just close your blinds and go to sleep like you would normally at night. The more you overcomplicate the simple process of sleep, the more counterproductive it will bite you in the ass later. 

You don't need blue light glasses. Your body will adapt and can handle the few minutes or extra hours before you go to sleep. Also: blue light filtered glasses have been increasingly declared useless by recent medical studies because they offer absolutely no provable benefits or evidence of actually doing anything.

You don't need sleep earplugs or headphones because you'll be so tired in the beginning phase that not even a siren will wake you up. After you've adjusted, you'll sleep as deep as you normally would in the night time on a normal schedule. Also: ears need space and air. Having them covered up/closed for 8 hours isn't healthy and can lead to medical problems.

You don't need sleeping aids because most of them are pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo. 

And you don't need meds unless a doctor specifically  said you do because your body can't handle itself. Otherwise you're just getting addicted or wasting money on something you neither need nor should use to begin with. Don't train your body that good sleep is only something that can be accomplished with 50 gadgets and preparations. It's not biologically natural, healthy and will absolutely bite you in the ass in your later life by leading to actual insomnia should you ever eventually return back to a ""normal"" life.

__

You generally seem to have fallen into the rabbit hole of everything pseudo-scientific in terms of sleep. 90% of these (medical) gadgets/items have 0 effect, are non-essential, not required and only exist to sell stuff to people who think any of it helps."
,"Most of what you just said isnt evidence based either lol. ""Just close your blinds and go to sleep"" is not useful advice for people who are wired when they get home from a crazy shift"
,"[melatonin](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/well/mind/melatonin-sleep-insomnia.html)

Regarding the use of Melatonin unless specifically described by a doctor. 

If you close your blinds, you don't need eye masks because those are only intended for environments where there is no chance of darkening it.

[blue filtered glasses](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/wellness/2023/07/03/do-blue-light-glasses-work/70307265007/)
Regarding blue filtered glasses. It's just another marketing scheme. If it was backed by science, then global medical facilities, eye doctors and insurances would support the use and prescription of those glasses, which they don't.

[ear muffs](https://www.healthline.com/health/sleeping-with-earplugs#side-effects)
Regarding ear muffs etc. that lead to your ear wax being stuck or even pushed back into your ear, causing health damage. Same logic as the eye blinds: unless you're sleeping near a highway or on an airport, your body doesn't need additional protection to help keep loud sounds out.


If you wanna talk shit about me not providing evidence, maybe provide some evidence of your own to counter-point instead of spewing medical BS that can lead to people developing health problems just because you wanna feel like an internet big boy and are encouraging their toxic health behaviour, that is often times an overreaction. Unlike you, I've consulted medical experts on how to handle night shifts, and they all confirmed what you can read in the evidence selection I posted above.

Working a ""crazy shift"" is sure as hell not going to get any better if you oversensitivize your body and system with overreactive measures, medicine and whatever else mumbo jumbo people still believe in nowadays. Again: nobody should take any supplements, medicine, drugs or other stuff unless prior medical consultation that CONFIRMS that you NEED to."
,Do you wear your headphones on top of earplugs ?
,"Damn lol
I legit have nothing of what you just named except AC and sleep just fine."
,Headband headphones.
,I work 1 week in 4 nights and if it wasn’t for promethazine ie phenergan (U.K.) I couldn’t do it
,Pillow?
,Blue light filters on all leds
,The jog or bike rides before bed so you feel physically tired
,"No, the complete opposite. This weekend I messed up my sleeping schedule and slept all three nights , best fucking sleep I've had in a long ass time. 

Slept like 7-9 hours each night and woke up refreshed and rejuvenated, not the least groggy and felt like I could tackle the day. Sleep felt so natural."
,"
Melatonin helped me"
,I had to go to days for a month. My sleep was messed up. I'd sleep for 12 hours then nap during the day then be exhausted for 10pm again. I switched back to nights and went right back to my 8 hour routine without much of an adjustment period. Maybe microdose some melatonin. I hope your sleep improves.
,"yes, but it was always temporary, longest was maybe 2 months.  I could never get into a ""normal"" schedule.  I would still fall asleep as soon as I was off work, then wake up at like 2am ready to start my day."
,"Yeah I do worse on days, definitely have a harder time sleeping."
,It always took me awhile to get used to days when I would do rotating shifts since I could never sleep the night before. Now that I permanently work 6am-230pm it's nice because I usually go to bed when it gets dark now and sleep much better. In the summer I was literally going to bed just after sunset and waking up around 430-5 am when the sun was rising.
,Are you depressed? I am and I'm chronically tired no matter what
,Nope.  It's the normal and optimal way to go about things.  If you're having trouble sleeping at nights I would suggest seeing your doctor.
,"in september i worked 14 nights in 18 days, then got a 2-week day off. those two weeks were the ugliest sleep of my life. i tried different melatonin but nothing worked. what worked? i started working more am and pm shift than night shift."
,I put a request in for a day shift mainly to protect myself from being fired. It'll be the first time in years that I will work during the day
,When I get fired I would let you know.
,"I think a large part of getting used to days is going to bed early and getting plenty of sleep. 
Pretty hard in our society actually. 

Get a SAD lamp and set it go off a few minutes before your alarm. I would read the news/Reddit during those minutes. 

Also, melatonin for first week to help reset your circadian rhythm;  stretching/relaxed range of motion exercises about an hour or two before bed; hot bath or shower just prior to bed; alcohol &amp; nicotine will worsen quality sleep."
,"Before 11pm - 7 am. Sleep was bad. It just felt like two - three naps. It was enough but never quality. Loved no traffic. Shopping for groceries at 8 am. 

Moved to 3pm - 11:30 pm. I can’t sleep when I get home. I’m up to 4-5 am. I wake up at before noon though, like before. 

I want to go sleep right away. I just can’t. Always been a night owl but night shift really cooked me. 

I tried melatonin when I was on nights. I hated waking up all groggy. My body wouldn’t feel “awake” until I got to work. lol"
,"Yes. It’s been two years and it’s gotten a little better. Now I can usually fall asleep at 1am but for the first 1.5 years after nights I was unable to fall asleep before 4am despite having to be up at 5/6am.

I’m still trying to find solutions myself with the help of my doctor but so far having a strict bedtime routine has done the most help. The usual no phones or bright lights, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, pretty much the same things we preach to those starting out on nights and needing to sleep during the day. 

My big issue was getting my brain to turn off at night. I feel so much more productive from 12am-4am so my doctor prescribed an anti anxiety medication for me to use before bed. I don’t have anxiety at night but it has helped a tiny bit to get my brain to chill. 

I highly recommend seeing a doctor, I feel like the sooner you tackle the issue the better."
,"Yes! I can only sleep between 4am and 4pm. The overnight shift was perfect. Now am on days, 2-10pm, and it's horrible. Sleeping right up until having to leave for work has me in a funk."
,I am the opposite tbh i prefer day shifts nights play havoc with my anxiety 99% of the time
,"My roster is 2 days 2 nights 5 off, 2 days 3 nights 4 off, 3 days 2 nights 5 off, all 6-6 shifts. I sleep much better during the day in between nights than at night but my sleep schedule is non existent"
,"Yes, but I'm a nightowl so was to be expected. No matter how much I slept on a ""normal"" schedule I was always tired during the day and energetic at night. No surprise I always shifted back to my nightowl sleep schedule"
,I think it just depends on the individual. Some people are simply night owls. I'm the same way I sleep better during the day then at night usually. Needless to say school sucked for me 😆. I did take sleep medication as a child for insomnia so sleep in general can be tough for me but yeah for some reason my insomnia is worse on dayshift then nightshift
,I did I had to start smoking weed to help me sleep
,Sleep right away after work. 5-6 hours of awake time to do daywalker things. Water and good meals overnight.
,What time do you sleep and wake and go to work?
,Work 10pm-6am. Sleep 8-4ish.
,i sleep as soon as i get home (7a) then get up at 2p-3p so i can do stuff during the day
,Work 7p to 7:30a. Sleep 10a to 5p (ideally). On days off sleep 5a to 1p.
,"VERY similar to me.

Work 7:00pm to 7:00am
Sleep day on 9:30am to 3:30pm
Sleep first day off 9:30am to 6:00pm (catchup on sleep)
Sleep day off 6:00am to 2:00pm"
,I commute by bike so good exercise is worked into my daily routine.
,"If I have several nights in a row, I get off at 7 am, and stay in bed from 9-5. I don’t have to sleep those 8 hours, but I make myself stay in bed. Up at 5, do random shit around the house, back to work for 7pm."
,Exercise and meal prep.
,I eat all my  meals at work so I don’t snack on junk. I keep the same sleep schedule regardless of day so I sleep well. I run or workout before work most days. Sleep 6-7 hours a night (day)
,"I get off work around 8:00. Do normal people stuff until 13:00 (try to squeeze in some exercise too) then start to wind down. I sleep at 14:30. 

I don’t eat overnight. My first meal is at 6:00, last meal is 12:00. Been a year in night shift now and I can honestly say that I have adjusted well."
,6p or 6a?
,6a
,"I work 10pm to 6am, leave work and go to the gym, then sleep from 9am to 5pm.

I also don’t eat that much at night. I have dinner with my family at about 5:30/6pm, then have a snack, like an apple, granola bar or yogurt every couple hours. When I get home, I have a small meal, usually leftover dinner or cereal.

I’ve been on nights consistently for a year and that’s what worked best for me!"
,"As few sweets as i can resist, only water and no eating after 12 at night until breakfast next day. Walk to work and back (instead of bike/train/bus), enough sleep."
,Watching what I eat and how frequently I eat. I work 6-6.
,"I get two unpaid 30’s and two paid 15’s on my 12 hour shift, try to walk laps around the parking lot during all of them. i try to eat low carb/atkins and avoid snacking. I also try to do weights three days a week and an hour on the exercise bike three days a week. I work 7 on 7 off essentially. Exercise is easier on the off days and diet is easier on the work days, but I try for both on both."
,"Proper sleep, meal prep, and regular exercise."
,"I work 2215-0645, eat at 1930 (with my family) 2330 and 0200. A sandwich, chips, cookies, yogurt and a fruit. I never really vary this. Also drink 2 liters of water from the time I get up, to the end of my shift. I take a fiber supplement, 1000iu vitamin d, and 250mg vitamin c. Get home by 0725 eat eggs with veggies. In bed by 0830, and try to sleep until 1530-1600. I've been doing this for 5 years now. That's always worked decently (I say decently because nothing is perfect on these overnights). In fact, lately, I feel wide awake all the time, not in a good way. Like when I used to get off worked I could barely keep my eyes open. Now I'm ready to go and do yard work, stay up with kids, read etc. Anyone experience this after 5+ years on overnights?"
,"I make sure I get 8-10 hrs of sleep a day.

Edit: day, not night."
,"I sleep from 830 am until 3 pm. I have an hour commute so I go immediately to bed, wear dark sunglasses for the ride. I take a melatonin 30 min into my ride home. I sleep for 6-7 hours and travel back one hour. On days off I arrive home and sleep about 4-5 hours and then go to bed later with my family so my routine is not off with the night time sleeping hours. 
I have been on this job for 5 years. My exercise and eating habits mirror many of the ones here, careful not to eat only a healthy snack at work. Caffeine is one cup when I wake up."
,"Stay away from fried food and sweets. Water only (no soda, even diet/caffeine free, no energy drinks) and exercise when you can"
,"Just flip your schedule around. Working nights doesn’t make you less healthy…? I still get my 2 workouts in a day and my diet stays the same, it’s a bit weird eating dinner in the morning but it is what it is. Just flip your schedule around, if you have a healthy diet and habits then there shouldn’t be any problems with working nights, just some getting used to."
,Some of us don't have the luxury of seeing the light of day especially in the winter during work week. So there's that too. Vitamin d helps. You lose protein in your blood and shit and metabolism slows down. Im stuck inside from 8pm to 9am meaning I only see light of day driving to and from work
,"I sleep 7 hours a day. I go to bed within two hours of getting off work. I wear blue light blocking glasses upon leaving work in order for my body to produce natural melatonin so that I will get good quality sleep and fall asleep naturally. I also do OMAD (one meal a day) and I don't eat anytime after 8pm. The later into the evening you eat, the more trouble your body has digesting that food and spiking your blood sugar levels. I also do a keto type diet with very low carb and sugar intake. Night shift affects the bodies ability to process sugars and carbs. Can lead to higher blood sugar and cause issues with insulin resistance. Right now, I am at the healthiest I've ever been in my life. On day shift I was overweight and low energy and living on caffeine. I am none of those things now."
,"I've done various things... so I work 10 PM - 8 AM.  I used to go on a bike ride for an hour during my lunch break but biking at night isn't very interesting... so I switched to taking walks  in our local state forest for an hour (it's like 10 min from my house) after work.  I've been slacking on the weekend bike rides though.

I sleep from about 12 noon until 9 PM or so.  Working from home and not having to commute an hour to and an hour from work has helped."
,"I Work from 9:30 to 7:30 I sleep from 8-4 I walk 4km 90% of days by Walking on my breaks at work and walking in the evening before work. I work from home and my street is a 390m loop so I do 10 loops and get 3.9k   


I've been on night shift for 11 years now and its WONDERFUL... BEST THING I EVER CHOSE TO DO!!"
,Only eat 2 nutri grain bars during my shift. Then 2 more for the ride home and a protien shake. Then wake up and drink a shake a have a bar. Go to the gym. Eat dinner. Repeat
,5-10 min walk every hour
,I take a really good multivitamin at the beginning of my shift. I take an organic food based one from Rainbow Light.
,"What's the brand multivitamin you use? I want to start taking them regularly, but theres a million to choose from"
,Rainbow Light. You can find them on Amazon
,"I work 11pm-7am. Before work at 7pm I work out, then I cook dinner after to eat before work and to also have a meal for lunch. After work I cook breakfast then sleep like a baby."
,Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Exercise and eat healthy. Same things you should do if you were day shift. But you must make them way more of a priority because night shift is already hard on the body.
,"I can't sleep as soon as I go home. I have to unwind and do stuff. I get all my chores and shopping done in the morning. I'll usually workout as soon as I get off or go for a bike ride then do the other stuff eat. Relax by watching a movie or a show then go to bed by about 10am usually. 

I work 7:15p.m to 4-6am depending on overtime and such"
,Stay healthy? 😓
,Y’all are healthy???
,"It's the same as working days, but at different times?"
,"If I fall into a 'day schedule' on my weekends...I always go for a nap Saturday night until 12am-1a. Then stay up all night to sleep for Sunday night shift. 

Typically sleep 1pm - 9pm give or take an hour or 2. (I work 11-7)"
,Swing shifts should be illegal or have way more pay and time off imo. Good luck.
,Agreed but just one night at least!
,Quit that job if you value your life.
,"After your 7am-3pm shift, try to stay awake as long as possible, ideally until around 8 or 9pm. Then take a short nap (3-4 hours). Wake up around midnight or 1am and stay awake until after your night shift ends at 7am. This will help reset your internal clock more quickly. After your night shift, head home, create a dark and quiet sleeping environment, and aim to sleep as long as your body will let you, ideally until around 3 or 4pm. This will set you up better for the subsequent night shifts. Everyone's body reacts differently, so listen to your body and adjust as needed."
,Thank you!!! That sounds like a good plan. I was thinking of trying something like that. :)
,One nap at a time. This is the way (of the nightshifter)
,"It”s one dayshift for orientation. I understand that. I work in the medical field. My go to every single day/night routine is Unisom to sleep, Rainbow Light organic multivitamin and coffee to be awake.  I cannot sleep without a sleep aid. I have screwed up my circadian rhythm so bad with my years and years shift work. It’s the only thing that works for me."
,Thankyou :) I’m also in the medical field. Ill look into those!
,"When I pick up my Unisom, look for the one with the active ingredient Doxycycline Succinate. Not the one with the same active ingredient as Benadryl. That gives me a hangover when I wake up and takes too long to shake off."
,you don't.
,"A few supplements you can take an hour before bed that are helpful are Glycine, magnesium l-threonate and Apigenin."
,I will try them.  Thx
,"I think you’re fully acclimated to night shift now. If you’ve been changing your schedule on the weekends, you never really got into a real sleep rhythm, and slowly but surely, you eventually did anyways. I work very similar hours as your and used to change my weekend hours by 4 hours so I could be up and at it by noon, but now I can’t really do that anymore, I can’t fall asleep for shit that early now. 

Anyways, that’s totally a guess as to why you can’t sleep. I can’t even change mine by a few hours anymore."
,Edit: my shift hours are 21:30-07:30
,"Could it be the change of the seasons and the sun setting earlier? Because I remember having trouble getting sleep this time last year and I’m dealing with it again. Going on like 3 weeks. I’ll go to bed around 10 and no matter what I’m waking up around 2-3pm. I also suspect my place is low on humidity now that I’ve gotta fire up the furnace and drying the place up. 

But I don’t do what you do regarding the days off, I keep the same sleep schedule all week. Maybe you’re just getting old"
,😂 maybe I am
