Clear your mind. Of everything. This my be tricky the first time you try it, but it’s essential for getting to sleep quickly. This should take about a minute and a half to clear your mind, especially at first, and is the preparation before the 120 second technique can begin. To clear your mind, you can first relax your face muscles, including your tongue, jaw, eye socket muscles. Drop your shoulders as low as they’ll go, and relax your upper and lower arm on one side and then the other. Start breathing slowly and relax your chest. Finally, relax your legs, including your thighs and your ca..."
"The answer is given by a prostitute who was capable of preaching even Sage Dattatreya. There was a prostitute named Pingala. One night she was waiting outside her house for clients. Whatever be the reason, no man turned up. She was worried and her worry turned into thinking. She realized how futile it was to wait for a man or Purusha, when she ought to be waiting for Purushothama or God. She gave up her desire for money to be made by catering to the needs of the men who come to her.She realized that desire (or Aasha) is the cause of sorrow and lack of desire (or Niraasha) is the cause of happinContinue ReadingThe answer is given by a prostitute who was capable of preaching even Sage Dattatreya.

That realization gave Pingala a very sound sleep. Vitamins may aid sleep up to some extent. Presence of bright light, electronic goods, taking coffee etc may hinder sleep. But it is the calmness of mind which is the leading factor in good and sound sleep. This calmness can be achieved only by controlling one’s desire, be it, promotion in office, first rank in examination, jewelry, the latest smartphone vacation in a luxury liner. It may be pointed out Buddha also preached that desire is the root cause of all sorrow. This is a long term solution for the problem."
"Well…that is interesting!!!

To get a good,peaceful night's sleep,I try any of the following:-

Wash just your feet with cold water and hop right into bed after dabbing your feet lightly with a towel(without drying of your entire feet). You will surely be snoring in 5 minutes
Pick up a book and read for around 10 minutes. Sleep will follow you.
Face over to one side and rub one of your feet slightly with the other. It feels absolutely blissful. Believe me.

Hope you are in for a peaceful night's sleep, Sean Kernan.

Graźie."

"I take a shower right before bed. Not a hot shower, warm in winter and cold in summer. Then fresh all cotton pjs and straight to bed. Knocks me right out and I get a deeper sleep.

If you think about it, our parents used to bathe us when we were little right before bed. It was to relax us, so why wouldn't it apply in adulthood?"
"I have a habit of getting on my phone before I sleep- be it watching a show or listening to soothing music or scrolling through my Quora feed. No matter how bloody tired I am, this is a ritual I faithfully uphold! Now the plight is, I only have a few designated moments for this.

There's no way I'm gonna leave a show halfway through or leave a song unfinished and sleep with that hollow, itchy feeling in my stomach. So ladies and gentlemen, let me have your attention, for I'm about to present my best night-time hack: Our brain hates to leave things unfinished. We like everything “whole”, “complete”. So instead of watching a whole 1 hour show(that I've already watched a hundred times before!) and losing precious sleep-time, I watch the first 5 minutes and then skip all the way to the end, and watch the last 5 or 10 mins. Instead of listening to every bit of every song,I fast-forward to the favourite bits of my favourite songs. It works. If you're like me and absolutely have to get on your phone before falling asleep, try tricking your mind like this. Your nights will be better— both because you sleep satisfied, and sleep more."
"The following list might help but there are no guarantees. Sometimes it works.

No daytime naps.
No coffee, tea or stimulating drinks in the afternoon.
30 minutes of exercise every day.
No heavy evening meals that will upset the digestion.
Have a clear conscience.
No fights with the partner without making up before bedtime.
Toss the television out of the bedroom.
Put in a good day’s work.
No smoking or hard drugs.
Limit the consumption of alcohol and that includes beer."

Keep your bed clean and comfortable. Room should be as chaos free and stress free as possible. I make sure to not go to bed hungry, I personally can not sleep if I’m hungry. I also give myself as few reasons to not sleep as possible. Chamomile tea relaxes me and helps me get sleepy. Valerian root has also worked well. There are different blends of “sleepy time tea,” that I have found have become a helpful part of my evening routine. Build a routine for the evening that helps bring you into a stress free comfort zone. I’ve found that routines in itself help place a mindset that makes sleep more attainable, which preps the mind for accepting sleep. Sort of like something your mind sees as a doable manifestation, rather than an unobtainable unicorn that’s only accessible to a select few. Steamed milk was something I did not like in the past and did not believe in, but there is something comforting and soothing about it that I’ve noticed helps me sleep as well, I’ve worked it into my tea routine to help shake things up, and have found it works very well with my tea as a tea latte. A hot shower or bath before going to bed also helps. Go to bed feeling fresh and clean helps amplify my levels of restful relaxation. Also, try to think of your daily schedule as having a dedicated time for solving things and allow yourself the block of evening as being “off duty,” towards solving those daily adulting tasks. Take stock of how you are doing: stress, depression, anxiety, and health overall can make sleep difficult. I’ve noticed when we sleep we can really experience the true raw state of being, our pure and vulnerable self. Think of yourself as a creature trying to fall asleep in a wild space somewhere. If you have this constant fear of harm, or that you have unfinished or unresolved problems hanging over your heart, of course it’s going to be difficult to sleep. You’ll be up at night caught in a state of hyper vigilance, looking for threats or solutions to problems. Sleep is a time that opens us up to both vulnerability but also a point that we confront our emotions in our dreams. This is where it becomes important for our bedroom to become a safe space for our emotions and emotional state. With all of this in mind… In this way, I’ve learned to look at my bedroom as a whole. I took out the TV, moved my computer out of the room. Both of those things can generate stress (the computer leads to thoughts of work, projects, unchecked bills and emails) and both of those can lead to being a crutch that keeps me awake. The bedroom is now maintained as a place of peace, sleep, relaxation, and calm. Of course there are clothing stored in the closet and dresser. But the room must be kept tidy and I’ve found for myself that clutter can be linked to feelings of stress. I choose to keep objects in neutral and calming colors. So there might be an aspect of some kind of zen going on. But I’ve found it to be very effective. I’ve also come to accept for myself that there might be nights where I just simply cannot sleep, I look at that as a symptom that warrants attention. I’ve found it as a good indicator to health. Good luck! (It’s ironic I’m typing this out at 11:46pm, goes to show the struggle is real and always a work in progress! Hahaha)"

"You can sleep only when your Body and mind are aligned together or when you've given your body enough physical exercises during the day that you sleep the minute you go to bed. You can do a mixture of these to ensure a good and deep sleep in the night. Give yourself some sort of physical activity during the day. 45–60 minutes will be a good deal to start with.

"I have many hacks for good sleep, but they are not necessarily “little known”. Like eating at least 3 hrs prior and not drinking too much water just before sleeping. Or taking a long warm shower and changing into clean light colored clothes before sleeping. Or exercising a lot earlier in the day. Or listening to soft music or reading a good soothing book just before sleeping. And so on.

But my probably ‘little known’ hack is to switch off the WiFi and put all my devices on flight mode before sleeping. If not the phone, then at least the tab and the laptop.

I don’t know the technical details of how this works, but it does. I sleep like a baby!"
"Some of the old fashioned methods help:A warm, milky drink before bed, something like ovaltine, hot chocolate, or just warm milk. Babies drop off soon after having milk, it's something to do with the hormones in the milk.Scents of chamomile and lavender are typically relaxing, and again for babies you find chamomile-infused baby bath gel, to relax them before bed. I think modern plug-in diffusers are excellent and you can put in any scented oil you want, natural essential oils are best. I can't stand artificial plug-ins. You can get a shit-ton of different oils and they serve different purposeContinue ReadingSome of the old fashioned methods help:A warm, milky drink before bed, something like ovaltine, hot chocolate, or just warm milk.

"If we are stressed or have any tension or due to some physical pain then only we have poor sleep, else we have sound sleep, you are lucky, another most important factor is doing Yoga and Meditation relaxes your mind and makes you fresh , so i would suggest you to take out 20-25 mins in morning from your schedule and start practicing and you will see the change. All the best and take care

You can even play this Ambient sound for a quality sleep :)"
"I'm really lucky, because I rarely have trouble sleeping unless there's an outside influence (such as restless pets) or if I'm mentally or emotionally troubled. But I also have a fairly consistent routine. Bedtime is at the same time every night, the room is dark and quiet, and no electronics are allowed. My phone stays in another room; I use an actual alarm clock with a display that I can turn off. I usually have a shower before bed, and a warm cup of herbal tea.

If Havoc is having an itchy day, he gets a dose of Benedryl. Then I kick all of the animals out of my room, and crawl into bed."
Well According to me Sleep is only a state of rest. Your body deserves the rest when it is totally exhausted . Just meditate i.e concentrate only on your breath for 15–20times you will get a sound sleep.
"Well, My Dad was an Ayurvedic Doctor, told me these hacks. You can try anyone for sound sleep

Apply some coconut oil to the feet before falling asleep.
While lying on the bed, close your eyes and observe your breathe. You won't even have a clue when you slipped into slumber. I can vouch on this
Having a cup of warm milk before sleep will induce sound sleep

Thanks,Aneesh."

First, you want to make sure you don’t have any hormone deficiency. Hypothyroidism and low DHEA can make you stay awake at night. Your doctor can diagnose this with blood tests and if deficient, hormone replacement will help restore your sleep. Similarly, older men are often deficient in testosterone and postmenopausal women are deficient in estrogen and progesterone. Replace what is missing and your sleep gets restored. It is often said that older people need less sleep. This is entirely false. They are more likely to be hormone deficient and health professionals often ignore the facts. So older people often have to suffer needlessly.2. A natural way to go to sleep: Melatonin is one of the hormones, produced in the pineal gland that often is lacking in older people. Use 3 mg of melatonin from the health food store to put you to sleep. If this alone does not work, add valerian from the health food store. A good starter dose is 500 mg capsules. Between the melatonin and valerian about 85% of people can fall asleep naturally. If you wake up in the middle of the night, take another 500 mg of valerian and another 3 mg of melatonin. This will put you back to sleep.3. Let Seriphos take care of your stress: often we can’t fall asleep or we wake up in the middle of the night because of stress.

December 18, 2021  Before we begin, I think it’s important to emphasize that your sleep needs are different from other people’s needs. What works for some may not work for you. These aren’t strict rules; they are suggestions. If you have not tried them, they may help you. If you find ones that don’t work, then you’ve learned something valuable about what does and does not work for you. The ONLY solid rule is that you need to be kind to yourself. Being unable to get the sleep you need is torture enough without beating yourself over the head. 1. Keep a journal. This is going to be a journey, and like any journey worth taking, it’s going to have its highs and lows. You’re going to be disappointed, you’ll be pleased, you’ll be crushed, and you’ll be elated. You’re most likely exhausted already, and by the end, I hope you get some rest. a) Whether you use pen and paper, a computer, or a phone to keep your journal is up to you, but there are things you definitely want to keep track of in your pre-bedtime journal * What time you went to bed (there will likely be more than one time to start off with, and that’s to be expected), when you got up, and how much sleep you got.
 * How you feel. Make your own scale of fatigue (I use 1 as “I’m too tired to move” and 10 as “HYPER!”)
 * What and when you eat and drink. Every single thing and the time is going to be important as well.
 * Medications, including dosage and what time you took it. Include everything: prescribed, over the counter, supplements, and illegals.
 * Your thoughts before bed (get it all out so your brain has less to sort through while it’s trying to sleep).
 * Quality of Life – This is the most important thing you will write in your journal, so you need to get it down. How is your insomnia affecting your quality of life? Couldn’t go out with friends because you’re a zombie? Write that down. Had to get someone else to walk your dog? Write that down. Because if this list doesn’t help you, you’re going to need to express to a doctor how severely your insomnia is impacting your quality of life. It’s the only language they speak. b) Keep a dream diary If you have frequent nightmares, excessive dreaming. or sleep paralysis, you can also keep a dream diary. You should write in it first thing in the morning, before you even get out of bed. 2. Get an app. I find that ones that work with a Fitbit or other smart watch work best, but the phone-based apps work well enough. This will give you valuable data. I use Sleep As Android [ http://sleep.urbandroid.org/ ] with my Samsung Gear2 [ http://sleep.urbandroid.org/documentation/integration/s-health/ ], but there are many apps out there to choose from. Five Best Sleep Tracking Gadgets or Apps [ http://lifehacker.com/5993005/five-best-sleep-tracking-gadgets-or-apps ] (Note: sleep apps cannot reliably track sleep stages. Use the info they give you as guidance, but not proof.) 3. Stick to a sleep schedule. For most people, this means the same bedtime(s) and wake up time(s), even on the weekends. No sleeping late, no unscheduled naps, and get to bed on time. This helps to regulate your body’s clock, and could help you fall asleep and stay asleep. If you fall asleep better at daybreak than 10 PM, and your schedule allows for it, go ahead and do that. If you do well sleeping for 4 hours, then being up for awhile, then going back to sleep, do that. Whatever you feel is most natural for you. a) If you have a Non-24 sleep-wake cycle [ http://www.non-24.com/about-non-24.php ] disorder (AKA Non-24, which is extremely rare in sighted people), it isn’t about the time on the clock, it’s about sticking to the schedule that works best for you. I do best when I’m up for 20 hours, then sleep 9.5 hours. Find what works for you. 4. Practice a relaxing bedtime routine. Boredom is key in getting your brain in the right place to prepare for sleep. A routine activity 30 minutes to an hour before bedtime, away from bright lights, helps separate your sleep time from the rest of your day. Nothing stimulating. Meditation, writing (in your journal or otherwise), reading or listening to a book you’ve read before, lying beneath the stars, some soft music, hanging out with a furry friend, a quiet conversation about non-stressful, non-exciting things, knitting, any activity that calms your mind. Sometimes you just need to brush your teeth, clean your face, get into your PJs, feed the cat, and other truly routine stuff. It is once your routine becomes truly routine that it will start working. 5. Take work/school materials, computers, and televisions out of the sleeping environment. I know, it’s hard, but it’s important. These objects have weight. Not just physical, but mental. They are not only things that stimulate your thinking, but they are also reminders of things you need to do. Those are both things to avoid when trying to get into the right state of mind for sleep. It can make a marked difference. 6. Exercise daily.  [ https://sleep.org/articles/exercise-affects-sleep/ ]Vigorous exercise is best, but even light exercise is better than no activity. Exercise at any time of day, but not at the expense of your sleep. 7. Think of your bedroom as your Sleep Palace. Reserve your bed for sleeping and sex only. Design your sleep environment to establish the conditions you need for sleep. * Keep it cool. Some new studies have shown that body temperature is actually more important than light (or lack thereof) for initiating sleep. The body’s core temperature needs to drop by about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep. Your bedroom should be cool. Between 15-19°C (60-67°F) is ideal for most people, but if you like sleeping under a heavy blanket, you could go lower. If you find you feel too warm at night, sticking your feet out from under the blanket will help cool you down. More info here: Keep It Cool for a Good Night’s Sleep [ https://insomniainsanity.wordpress.com/2016/09/30/keep-it-cool-for-a-good-nights-sleep/ ]
 * Your bedroom should also be free from any noise or light that can disturb your sleep. Consider using blackout curtains, eye mask, earplugs, white noise machines or apps, humidifiers, fans, purring kitty, or other devices.
 * Make sure that your room smells good. Bad smells can cause nightmares and prevent you from getting quality sleep. Clean up anything that is causing bad odors, but also don’t overdo things like using strong chemicals. Air out your room as often as possible, but take precautions if you have seasonal allergies. Find out more about the effects of indoor air quality here [ https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/introduction-indoor-air-quality ]. 8. Dress for Success. It’s more than just staying cool or warm, it’s about feeling good. Get yourself some PJs that make you feel cozy (and cute, if you like). You want to engage as many senses as possible with the idea of sleep. 9. Build your nest. Make sure your mattress is comfortable and supportive. Have comfortable pillows. And make the room attractive and inviting for sleep, but also free of allergens that might affect you.

December 18, 2021  Before we begin, I think it’s important to emphasize that your sleep needs are different from other people’s needs. What works for some may not work for you. These aren’t strict rules; they are suggestions. If you have not tried them, they may help you. If you find ones that don’t work, then you’ve learned something valuable about what does and does not work for you. The ONLY solid rule is that you need to be kind to yourself. Being unable to get the sleep you need is torture enough without beating yourself over the head. 1. Keep a journal. This is going to be a journey, and like any journey worth taking, it’s going to have its highs and lows. You’re going to be disappointed, you’ll be pleased, you’ll be crushed, and you’ll be elated. You’re most likely exhausted already, and by the end, I hope you get some rest. a) Whether you use pen and paper, a computer, or a phone to keep your journal is up to you, but there are things you definitely want to keep track of in your pre-bedtime journal * What time you went to bed (there will likely be more than one time to start off with, and that’s to be expected), when you got up, and how much sleep you got.
 * How you feel. Make your own scale of fatigue (I use 1 as “I’m too tired to move” and 10 as “HYPER!”)
 * What and when you eat and drink. Every single thing and the time is going to be important as well.
 * Medications, including dosage and what time you took it. Include everything: prescribed, over the counter, supplements, and illegals.
 * Your thoughts before bed (get it all out so your brain has less to sort through while it’s trying to sleep).
 * Quality of Life – This is the most important thing you will write in your journal, so you need to get it down. How is your insomnia affecting your quality of life? Couldn’t go out with friends because you’re a zombie? Write that down. Had to get someone else to walk your dog? Write that down. Because if this list doesn’t help you, you’re going to need to express to a doctor how severely your insomnia is impacting your quality of life. It’s the only language they speak. b) Keep a dream diary If you have frequent nightmares, excessive dreaming. or sleep paralysis, you can also keep a dream diary. You should write in it first thing in the morning, before you even get out of bed. 2. Get an app. I find that ones that work with a Fitbit or other smart watch work best, but the phone-based apps work well enough. This will give you valuable data. I use Sleep As Android [ http://sleep.urbandroid.org/ ] with my Samsung Gear2 [ http://sleep.urbandroid.org/documentation/integration/s-health/ ], but there are many apps out there to choose from. Five Best Sleep Tracking Gadgets or Apps [ http://lifehacker.com/5993005/five-best-sleep-tracking-gadgets-or-apps ] (Note: sleep apps cannot reliably track sleep stages. Use the info they give you as guidance, but not proof.) 3. Stick to a sleep schedule. For most people, this means the same bedtime(s) and wake up time(s), even on the weekends. No sleeping late, no unscheduled naps, and get to bed on time. This helps to regulate your body’s clock, and could help you fall asleep and stay asleep. If you fall asleep better at daybreak than 10 PM, and your schedule allows for it, go ahead and do that. If you do well sleeping for 4 hours, then being up for awhile, then going back to sleep, do that. Whatever you feel is most natural for you. a) If you have a Non-24 sleep-wake cycle [ http://www.non-24.com/about-non-24.php ] disorder (AKA Non-24, which is extremely rare in sighted people), it isn’t about the time on the clock, it’s about sticking to the schedule that works best for you. I do best when I’m up for 20 hours, then sleep 9.5 hours. Find what works for you. 4. Practice a relaxing bedtime routine. Boredom is key in getting your brain in the right place to prepare for sleep. A routine activity 30 minutes to an hour before bedtime, away from bright lights, helps separate your sleep time from the rest of your day. Nothing stimulating. Meditation, writing (in your journal or otherwise), reading or listening to a book you’ve read before, lying beneath the stars, some soft music, hanging out with a furry friend, a quiet conversation about non-stressful, non-exciting things, knitting, any activity that calms your mind. Sometimes you just need to brush your teeth, clean your face, get into your PJs, feed the cat, and other truly routine stuff. It is once your routine becomes truly routine that it will start working. 5. Take work/school materials, computers, and televisions out of the sleeping environment. I know, it’s hard, but it’s important. These objects have weight. Not just physical, but mental. They are not only things that stimulate your thinking, but they are also reminders of things you need to do. Those are both things to avoid when trying to get into the right state of mind for sleep. It can make a marked difference. 6. Exercise daily.  [ https://sleep.org/articles/exercise-affects-sleep/ ]Vigorous exercise is best, but even light exercise is better than no activity. Exercise at any time of day, but not at the expense of your sleep. 7. Think of your bedroom as your Sleep Palace. Reserve your bed for sleeping and sex only. Design your sleep environment to establish the conditions you need for sleep. * Keep it cool. Some new studies have shown that body temperature is actually more important than light (or lack thereof) for initiating sleep. The body’s core temperature needs to drop by about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep. Your bedroom should be cool. Between 15-19°C (60-67°F) is ideal for most people, but if you like sleeping under a heavy blanket, you could go lower. If you find you feel too warm at night, sticking your feet out from under the blanket will help cool you down. More info here: Keep It Cool for a Good Night’s Sleep [ https://insomniainsanity.wordpress.com/2016/09/30/keep-it-cool-for-a-good-nights-sleep/ ]
 * Your bedroom should also be free from any noise or light that can disturb your sleep. Consider using blackout curtains, eye mask, earplugs, white noise machines or apps, humidifiers, fans, purring kitty, or other devices.
 * Make sure that your room smells good. Bad smells can cause nightmares and prevent you from getting quality sleep. Clean up anything that is causing bad odors, but also don’t overdo things like using strong chemicals. Air out your room as often as possible, but take precautions if you have seasonal allergies. Find out more about the effects of indoor air quality here [ https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/introduction-indoor-air-quality ]. 8. Dress for Success. It’s more than just staying cool or warm, it’s about feeling good. Get yourself some PJs that make you feel cozy (and cute, if you like). You want to engage as many senses as possible with the idea of sleep. 9. Build your nest. Make sure your mattress is comfortable and supportive. Have comfortable pillows. And make the room attractive and inviting for sleep, but also free of allergens that might affect you. Clean sheets and a comfy blanket or comforter can help...https://insomniainsanity.quora.com/Insomnia-Insanity-s-Sleep-Hygiene-Musts"

We have been very busy in our minds, always curious, wanting to connect with the world and not been left behind. Most of us want to stay relevant and constant engaging on social media, either commenting, liking, re-posting and sharing different posts. There is a fear of being alone and irrelevant. Growing up, I was a person who wanted to be alert and always involved with my friends and relatives. I looked forward for new days, new friends and active socially involved🌻When alone, I would fall into my dream land, imaging good stuffs happening in my life, thinking of the greater future full of everlasting love and laughter. I had huge imagination. I was always busy inside my mind 🌸 This brought a lot of anxious thoughts, worries and fear -I was on guard and very protective of myself and my future. I had this deep rooted fear which I never understood where it came from and always avoided it. These emotions and fear made it difficult to sleep well at night. My sleeping pattern was poor and unhealthy. Every night before I slept, I would pray asked my God for protection from bad things, bad people, demons and you name it. I did not like to go to bed at all because I was always scared. I would watch movies/series, play with my phone or day dream. My best hobby was day dreaming- building a lot of castles in my mind to avoid sleeping. I became very lazy and spend my time thinking and worrying. In stead of sleeping, I would play the scene of a film I have watched before in my mind, or imagine things I would like it to happen. I had a lot of anxieties and expectations. There are many expert who talks about the most important habits one must practice in order to sleep well or to cure insomnia, example: Be active during the day: engage yourself in different chores and activities will enable one to be tired and enhance or improved sleep. Exercise daily; Experts/researcher have advised the importance of exercising( jogging, walking, yoga, running, gym, swimming and other more) regularly or in a daily basis could improve Insomnia or sleeping difficulties🌸 Meditation: It is has been scientifically prove that one who meditates regularly can improves their poor sleeping habits. Today I will talk about how Meditation has change my poor sleeping habits to a better and healthy one. I remember the day I join meditation, I was very excited because I read a lot of its positive benefits. I was eager and looking forward to practice it. I wanted to get rid of my fears, anxieties and overthinking. My meditation instructor told me that my mind is fake because it is made of pictures of my past events ( karma), habits (inherited from my parents and ancestors) and body. She also added that my fear, anxieties, overthinking, questions and doubts comes from these pictures. So in order to set myself free, I was given a method that enabled me to discard/throw away my fake mind. After meditating for a while now, I realized all my fears and anxiety were fake and false because they were just pictures 😇 I was living inside my mind world and I have been holding onto my mind, believing and protecting it. This brought a lot of suffering, anxiety, therefore I could not sleep well. During the night, my mind couldn’t stop racing around, imagining things, worrying about the past and the future. I was very busy inside my mind. In order to avoid overthinking, I had to keep myself busy either watching movies/series till late at night and sometimes until in mornings. Sometimes I spent my nights chit-chat or talking over the phone for hours😥After throwing away all of my fake mind, eventually my bad sleeping habits disappeared. Before sleeping, I meditate for five minutes and I slept like a baby🌿Meditation has helped me to get rid of my overthinking and day-dreaming habits that made me not to sleep well which made me not active during the day. Now days, when I wake up, I take a long walks with my husband and sometimes my neighbor. After a walk, I make breakfast and snacks for my children to take to school. Lately, I feel very active and very light.My mind is not racy anymore, when I feel like stressed and worry, I meditate and feel better. My nights are very calm and relaxed. Thank you to this amazing Meditation method that have changed my life 💚 I will share this video of how to clear your mind. I hope it helps you😁"
"1. Early Morning Exercise and Sunlight The first, and simplest way to fix your sleep patterns is to spend the first 15 minutes of your day engaged in light physical activity in direct sunlight. The hormones released during exercise and from sunlight work wonders to reset your circadian rhythm and improve your sleep cycles.

Early Morning Exercise and Sunlight The first, and simplest way to fix your sleep patterns is to spend the first 15 minutes of your day engaged in light physical activity in direct sunlight. The hormones released during exercise and from sunlight work wonders to reset your circadian rhythm and improve your sleep cycles. To quote the Sleep Master himself, Shawn Stevenson, host of The Model Health Show: “The production and secretion of melatonin is powerfully affected by light exposure. Sunlight provides the natural spectrum of light that we need to help coordinate the cycle of melatonin production. Get more light during the day, less light at night, and you’re on your way to having a magic sleep formula.” Furthermore, studies have shown that individuals who exercise early in the morning tend to have far more (and longer) deep sleep cycles than individuals who train in the afternoon or at night. This doesn’t mean you need to do your heaviest training in the morning (I don’t). Simply, that you should train in the morning to release those circadian rhythm optimizing hormones. In fact, some studies show that as little as 7-minutes of hard training (I’d recommend two sets of Tabata) are enough to elicit the desired response and help you sleep like a babe. 2. Wake Up at the Same Time Every Day (No Matter When You Went to Bed) Psychiatrist and internet sensation Dr. Jordan Peterson has stated both on podcasts and in his book 12 Rules for Life that one of the FIRST things he does with any depressed patient is instruct them to adhere to a strict wake up schedule. He said it matters less what time you go to bed and more what time you wake up. By consistently waking up at the same time everyday, you will help get your body into a routine and synchronize your circadian rhythm. If you go to bed late, wake up at the same time you normally would and take a nap. It’s better for you. 3. Cut Caffeine After 2 p.m . Plain and simple. Caffeine will fuck up your sleep cycles like nothing else. If you have a high tolerance for caffeine you can probably set a caffeine curfew of 4 p.m. but if you’re a light weight like me, cut it after 2. 4. No More Alcohol 3 Hours Before Bed So here’s the sneaky thing about alcohol. It DOES make it easier for you to fall asleep. But, the tricky little bastard also reduces the amount of deep sleep and REM sleep you get during each sleep cycle. Tim Ferriss recommends drinking 2 glasses of wine about 4 hours before bed and I’ve found in my own experience that as long as I stop drinking three hours before I plan to sleep, I feel much better the next day. 5. Turn Off Screens After 9 p.m. Ok, so I’ll admit I don’t often take my own advice here, BUT…this is still an important tactic to discuss. Your hormones are directly impacted by the light your eyes and body receive during the day. When you are staring at blue light emitting screens until 11 p.m., you suppress melatonin production and signal to your body “Hey, it’s time to be awake.” Then, when you switch off and try to fall asleep, you wonder why you don’t feel tired. Whenever possible, try to dim the lights and turn off screens after 9 p.m., it makes a huge impact on your sleep quality. Or…Buy a pair of blue light blocking Swannies and enjoy your screen time guilt free. 6. Go to bed by 11 p.m Around 11, your body releases a dump of chemicals that are designed to help repair your body and clean out your system while you sleep. BUT… If you’re still awake at that time, those chemicals will only serve to keep you awake, instead of helping your body repair itself. Do yourself a favor and try to go to bed before 11 p.m. or 2 a.m. at the very latest. You’ll notice that 6 hours of sleep from 11 to 5 feels far more restful than 8 hours of sleep from 2 to 10. If you don’t believe me, try it for yourself and let me know how it feels. Hope this helps.

Here are a few small habits that have worked for me.Set a bedtime alarm to go off 30 minutes before sleep. It’s a signal to the brain that you need to finish up any activities you're working on: reading, writing notes, doing exercises, working on a class project. Don’t just create this habit for every working day; extend it to weekends so that it has a better chance to stick.Have a smaller meal for dinner. If you have a habit of eating the biggest meal of the day at night, your sleep can be disrupted. I try to avoid fried food and caffeine, and instead go with a lighter dinner with a big salad and some protein such as grilled fish or chicken. Try to eat at least a few hours before bedtime.Take a short walk after you eat. It can be just 20 minutes. Being outside is good for your digestion, you inhale fresh air, and you give your busy mind some time to pause from everything you've been working on that day. A walk also sends signals to the body that it’s time to unwind and relax.Get away from electronics in the hour before bedtime. This applies to your computer and TV. Looking at a screen keeps you alert. What can you do instead? Listen to a podcast or queue up some relaxing music and listen with your eyes closed as you’re sitting on the couch.Write in your journal. You may want to write about your day, or even jot down a list of to-do items that are top priority for the next day. The benefit of writing a task list is that you train your mind to focus a few steps ahead so you don’t worry about forgetting something important, which could keep you awake at night.Make your room sleep-friendly. Sleep in a well ventilated room, keep your window open at least a little, and turn off your devices. To prevent any noise from waking you up, invest in a good pair of soft silicone ear plugs like these so you can sleep through the night.Have a cup of herbal tea. It can be any tea without caffeine, or you can take a magnesium supplement or a melatonin supplement around the time your alarm goes off. The warm drinks can help you feel more sleepy, and the supplements promote healthy sleep and relaxation.Take a deep breath of lavender. Lavender oil can help us relax before going to sleep. Keep a small bottle on your night stand and put a few drops into the palm of your hand. Rub your palms together to release the essence of the oil, then run your fingers over your temples, forehead, around your nose, and over your pillow.End the day on a positive note. Before you turn out the lights and close your eyes, ask yourself, What went well today? Maybe you completed a section of an important project, spent an hour on the phone with a good friend, or finally got around to finishing a task you’ve been avoiding for weeks. Give yourself a minute to feel grateful for that experience. It really helps to relax."
"I still remember the night, when I was sitting in the hotel veranda in Goa and watching heavy rain and thunder storm. I could not sleep as I was dreaming to be with someone, with whom I spent the entire day on the beach. She was a beautiful stranger. We befriended on the beach following an accident. I was chilling at a nearby area with my ipod switched on; just watching the waves. And this girl, out of no where bumped into me while carrying her lime juice glass. I suddenly helped her to stand up, asking like a gentleman, if she is OK. She smiled and said, she is sorry and walk by.

I was chilling at a nearby area with my ipod switched on; just watching the waves. And this girl, out of no where bumped into me while carrying her lime juice glass. I suddenly helped her to stand up, asking like a gentleman, if she is OK. She smiled and said, she is sorry and walk by. I don’t know why but her touch was so sensuous, that I could not stopped myself from turning my head, over and over again to have have her glimpse again. She was also chilling with her friends nearby. And to my surprise, she also didn’t loose a single chance and was literally watching me out. We often smiled at each other. She even gave me her number, while writing it on the sand. I was quick to respond. We immediately started chatting in less than 2 hours of a meeting. I asked her to meet behind a beach shack. I got a chance to talk to her and see her again from close. She is amazingly beautiful Sindhi girl and a little chit chat exposed that she is smart, fast and naughty enough to handle. She was quite friendly and was quick to express herself with hugs and subtle touch. I guess I got all the indications right and we had beer together. I don’t know, how time flies and it was late evening around 7:30 PM. She asked to leave and I wanted to spend more time with her. I gave her my room number, as we were staying in the same hotel. We decided to meet again next afternoon at the same place. Now, it was a mild astonishment, when my room’s bell rang at around 10:15 pm. Exactly, when I was sitting in the hotel veranda enjoying rain and doing some work on my laptop. I couldn’t believe my eyes! it was her. I was numb for a moment and she asked me to come in and spend some time with me. I was ALL up for it. In few minutes, she was straight to the point, as she sounded like a no nonsense girl. Our eyes were already rolling on each other and breaking the ice, she gave way and started caressing me. I knew what was coming next. Needless to say, we had some great time together. We were so much so into each other, that I even don’t remember, how many times made love. It was one hell of a passionate and wild night of my life. In the morning, when I woke up. I realized that I slept like a baby and felt so fresh. There was no sign of her in my room, seems like she already left a while back, without letting me know. I texted her and realized that she have a flight to catch at 10 AM in morning. It was 8:30 AM when I woke up. I could not meet or see her ever again. She is still in my memories. Its been more than 2 years now. She changed her number as well. I shared these details for the first time today. Otherwise, no one else knows about it, except for me and her and obviously the Almighty. Thanks for making me recall those memories and the best sleep ever. Hope to see her again in this life!!!"

In other words, stressors that affect our circadian clocks, such as blue-light exposure, can have much more serious consequences than originally thought.A healthy adult person needs atleast 8 hours of sound/deep/delta sleep.Apart from all the above things, our Earth and it's magnetic field puts a deep impact on our brain and sleep.

But did you know the position in which you sleep impacts your health? There are certain sleeping positions that are considered best because they provide the maximum health benefits. According to Ayurveda, sleeping on your left side, also called Vamkushi is the best sleeping position. Sleeping on the left side contributes to your health by making the work of your organs easy. Not just this, there are many other health benefits that sleeping on your left side provides. Some of the important health benefits are listed below: 1.Better heart functioning:- Our heart is on the left side and when you sleep on the same side, the lymph drainage towards the heart is helped by the gravity, taking some workload off the heart while you sleep 2.​Better digestion:- Sleeping on your left side allows the gravity to encourage the food waste to move more easily from the small intestine into the large intestine through ileocecal valve (ICV). So, with the help of gravity and good sleep, the descending colon is full of waste and ready to get eliminated from the body easily. 3.Good for pregnant women:- Experts advise pregnant women to sleep on the left side as much as they can because doing so helps in taking the pressure off their backs and also increases the blood flow to the foetus and uterus. Sleeping on the left also helps in smooth flow of nutrients to the placenta. You can bend your knees lightly and keep a pillow in between your legs to make the position even more comfortable for you. 4.Prevents snoring:- You may not believe it but sleeping on your left actually helps in reducing and even stopping snoring. The reason behind it is that sleeping on your left keeps your tongue and throat in a neutral position and thus keeps your airways clear for you to be able to breathe properly. Sleeping on your back may make snoring even worse and breathing difficult. 5.Improves the blood flow:-Spleen is a part of the lymphatic system, which is also on the left side. Spleen in addition to filtering lymph also filters blood. So, when you lay on your left side, drainage back to the spleen is helped and made easier by gravity. Helping the lymph to drain to the heart and spleen with gravity is good for the body. 6.​Other benefits:-Apart from these major health benefits, there are many other health benefits that include, relieving neck and back pain, helping in purifying toxins from the body, preventing many serious illnesses, improving the function of kidney and liver, preventing acidity and heartburn, impacting the brain positively and delaying the onset of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s"

"Better sleep quality depends on several aspects. For better sleep you can use these techniques: a. Keep a Proper Schedule of Sleep: Wake and sleep every day on the same time. Sleep latest by 11 pm and wake by 6 to 7 am covering a complete 7 - 8 hours of sleep. Even on weekends do not sleep late and wake up late as that affects your cycle. If you want to have a nap in afternoon, make sure its not more than 15 - 20 mins as if it is more than that you tend to take time to fall asleep at night. b.

If you want to have a nap in afternoon, make sure its not more than 15 - 20 mins as if it is more than that you tend to take time to fall asleep at night. b. Exposure to light: Exposure to light during daytime is important but during the night time its opposite. Light influences our internal clock through specialized light sensitive cells in the retina. These cells, which occupy the same space as the rods and cones that make vision possible, tell the brain whether it is daytime or nighttime, and our sleep patterns are set accordingly. So maintain the internal clock. Use of laptop and smartphone which have blue emitted lights and it affected the Melatonin hormone which is responsible for deep sleep. So reduce use of smartphone and laptop. Keep your phone away from you and keep it in airplane mode it possible. Also keep the bedroom dark or dim light so that you can sleep properly. c. Exercise in the day time: Exercise increase your metabolism and stimulates hormones such as cortisol. Exercising too close to bedtime can interfere your sleep. Try to finish moderate to vigorous workouts at least three hours before bedtime. If you’re still experiencing sleep difficulties, move your workouts even earlier. Relaxing, low-impact exercises such as yoga or gentle stretching in the evening can help promote sleep. You can also try Yoga Nidra or Shawasan for better sleep d. Limit Caffeine and Nicotine: Tea and Coffee or smoking can disturb your sleep. So if you are a person you likes tea and coffee or smoke, then you need to make sure you have it before 3 pm not after that. e. Do not heavy meal or water: Avoid having heavy meals especially carbohydrate rich meals in dinner as you feel bloated and take time to sleep. Also avoid taking too much water before bed as you tend to wake up in middle of night to use toilet and will take time to go back to sleep again f. Avoid brain storming: Its often happens that when you go to bed you tend to think on few things going on in life. Try to avoid that as much as possible as that does not allow your brain muscles to relax. g. Add Peppermint or Chamomile tea: Even after all these you are unable to sleep well, add cool peppermint or chamomile tea 30 mins before bedtime. It helps relaxing your gut as well as your brain muscles and activates the Melatonin which is sleep hormone. I hope I answered your query."
"I recently discussed with my coworkers about how I was sometimes having dreams about recruiting and work in general. Upon learning this, one of them told me that it might have been because I was either checking my emails, on my phone, or using my laptop right before the bed. Her tip for me was something that she practices herself which is not to be on the phone or email at least 30 minutes before bed.

I think to be in a healthy sleeping state, we probably just have to give ourselves some time to wind down a bit and even though it's such a small change to make - it has really helped!"
"As it turns out, sleeping on your side is actually pretty good for you — especially if you're sleeping on your left side. Not only can it help reduce snoring, it's great for your digestion and might even reduce heartburn. An older study looked at 10 people over the course of two days. The first day, participants rested on their right side after eating a high-fat meal. On the second, they switched to the left side.

"3 Ways to Improve Sleep QualityStages of SleepThere are several stages in your sleep cycle, alternating between NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Each complete sleep cycle lasts around 90 minutes[1] and repeats several times throughout the night. 2. Making Lifestyle ChangesOne of the most effective changes you can make to improve your slumber is to sleep at the same time every day. Try to maintain this even during the weekends.

Each complete sleep cycle lasts around 90 minutes[1] and repeats several times throughout the night. 2. Making Lifestyle ChangesOne of the most effective changes you can make to improve your slumber is to sleep at the same time every day. Try to maintain this even during the weekends. After a while, your body clock or circadian rhythm will get accustomed to these timings. This will help you to fall asleep at night and make it easier for you to wake up in the mornings. As your body starts to get used to these new timings, you will automatically wake up—even without an alarm clock. It is a good idea to make this change slowly, for instance, try sleeping earlier each day. You should also avoid using your mobile phone, computer or tablet at least 30 mins before bedtime as the blue light emitted can make it harder for you to have a good night’s sleep If you’re not already exercising regularly, it may be a good idea to start.Regular exercise, particularly in the morning or afternoon, can impact sleep quality by raising your body temperature a few degrees. Later in the day, when your internal thermostat drops back to normal range, this can trigger feelings of drowsiness and help you sleep better. If you exercise outdoors, you will be exposed to natural light, which helps your body establish a good sleep-wake cycle3. Creating a Conducive Sleeping EnvironmentDo not underestimate the benefits that a comfortable environment can do for your sleep. If your surroundings are noisy, play white noise, nature sounds or calming music to mask the noise. Shades, eye masks, and earplugs are other things you can use to help achieve a cool, dark and quiet environment. It might also be a good idea to start a bedtime ritual to get yourself ready for bed. Try winding down by dimming the bright lights, listening to soft music, reading a book or taking a warm bath. If you still can’t fall asleep, try listening to soothing music—or noise—such as white noise or nature sounds. Try each of these and see which you respond to the best."

I sleep peacefully for the rest of night.

There is peace of mind and heart is at ease.

Nothing can ever replace that feeling.

Undoubtedly the best sleep."

All we need is a bit if awareness and concern. That’s all it requires.Don’t we human knows how to understand our sleep patterns. common.. man.It all lies in the mindset of the person. Everyone has a different sleeping patterns which defines one’s overall sleeping Quality that they are getting out of the given 24 hours to us. It is very important to understand your sleep quality of the nights and productivity of your working hours.

Can you hire a person to see how well you are sleeping in the nights. No right because being a human he wants sleep as well . It is really that important for every one of us. But waitI have an alternative. Yes. a small fitness band which takes care of you while your sleeping too.Don’t you already feel good that you can buy a tech that works for you while you are sleeping. Yes buddy. Get a reliable smart band ( Not necessarily from the brands like Apple ).You have better options under budget. I myself brought Honor band 5 for myself after a lot of research into the smart bands. It has 6 axis sensors while brands like mi are still giving 3 axis sensors with almost the same price and you guess what, It is working like a charm. Trust me. It gives the Quality of sleep with better accuracy. (Do your research on youtube and compare). It divides and and differentiates by the overall hours into Deep, Light and REM sleep which is the vital part of your sleep. Coming to my experience, I was not getting enough deep sleep for myself. My observation is almost same for weeks using the band and I decided to do something about it. see , I have read that the average person spends about 26 years sleeping in their life which equates to 9,490 days or 227,760 hours. Surprisingly, we also spend 7 years trying to get to sleep. It is almost One third of your life time. Don’t you think It is really important to actually give importance to one’s sleep quality. So I Decided to buy a comfortable mattress and Pillow this time. yes. I brought memory foam mattress (From wakefit) and a comfortable pillow and guess what. I continued to observe my sleep quality using the statistics given by the band every morning and yes there are tremendous changes I notice. Apparently my deep sleep hours got improved and I feel a lot better and productive these days and I suggested same to my friends and they are also happy making such small changes giving them big impact. I would suggest the same if you are here for the same. upvote if you are thinking to make such small changes for the sake of your health."

These basic hints will assist you with dozing better and be increasingly vivacious and gainful during the day. Pooch resting in a bed How might I show signs of improvement night's rest? Resting soundly legitimately influences your psychological and physical wellbeing. Miss the mark and it can negatively affect your daytime vitality, efficiency, enthusiastic equalization, and even your weight. However, a significant number of us routinely thrash around evening time, attempting to get the rest we need. Getting a decent night's rest may appear to be an inconceivable objective when you're wide wakeful at 3 a.m., yet you have significantly more power over the nature of your rest than you most likely figure it out. Similarly as the manner in which you feel during your waking hours frequently relies on how well you rest around evening time, so the solution for rest troubles can regularly be found in your day by day schedule. Unfortunate daytime propensities and way of life decisions can leave you hurling and turning around evening time and unfavorably influence your state of mind, cerebrum and heart wellbeing, invulnerable framework, innovativeness, imperativeness, and weight. Be that as it may, by exploring different avenues regarding the accompanying tips, you can appreciate better rest around evening time, help your wellbeing, and improve how you think and feel during the day. Tip 1: Keep in a state of harmony with your body's characteristic rest wake cycle Getting in a state of harmony with your body's normal rest wake cycle, or circadian mood, is one of the most significant systems for dozing better. On the off chance that you keep a customary rest wake plan, you'll feel substantially more revived and stimulated than if you rest a similar number of hours on various occasions, regardless of whether you just change your rest plan by an hour or two. Attempt to rest and get up simultaneously consistently. This helps set your body's inside the clock and enhance the nature of your rest. Pick a sleep time when you typically feel tired, so you don't thrash around. In case you're getting enough rest, you should wake up normally without an alert. On the off chance that you need a morning timer, you may require a previous sleep time. Abstain from snoozing—even on ends of the week. The more your end of the week/weekday rest plans contrast, the more terrible the jetlag-like side effects you'll encounter. On the off chance that you have to compensate for a late-night, choose a daytime rest as opposed to staying in bed. This enables you to take care of your rest obligation without upsetting your normal rest wake beat. Be shrewd about resting. While snoozing is a decent method to compensate for lost rest, in the event that you experience difficulty nodding off or staying unconscious around evening time, snoozing can compound the situation. Limit snoozes to 15 to 20 minutes in the early evening. Battle after-supper sleepiness. In the event that you get a lethargic path before your sleep time, get off the love seat and accomplish something somewhat animating, for example, washing the dishes, calling a companion, or preparing garments for the following day. On the off chance that you surrender to the sluggishness, you may get up later in a tough situation returning to rest. Tip 2: Control your introduction to light Melatonin is a normally happening hormone constrained by a light introduction that manages your rest wake cycle. Your cerebrum secretes more melatonin when it's dull—making you sluggish—and less when it's light—making you increasingly alert. Be that as it may, numerous parts of current life can change your body's generation of melatonin and move your circadian beat. Step by step instructions to impact your presentation to light During the day: Open yourself to splendid daylight in the first part of the day. The closer to the time you get up, the better. Have your espresso outside, for instance, or have breakfast by a bright window. The light all over will assist you with awakening Invest more energy outside during sunlight. Take your work breaks outside in daylight, practice outside, or walk your canine during the day rather than around evening time. Let however much regular light into your home or workspace as could reasonably be expected. Keep drapes and blinds open during the day, and attempt to draw your work area nearer to the window. On the off chance that fundamental, utilize a light treatment box. This reproduces daylight and can be particularly helpful during short winter days.

Lay down on your bed
Close your eyes and start visualizing everything that happened on that particular day in reverse order.

Coming to the answer of the question,how can you make sure that you have slept well?Well if you would have slept in night or day time you would feel fresh and lighter. In my case I used to take medicines to sleep,and if I could not slept well in night,I would feel more sleepy and drowsy in day time.Also I used to feel poor concentration,think a lot and used to had headache.But if I would have slept well taking medicines I do not used to had all these problems. So guys if you are slept well last night and don't have poor concentration,a lot of thinking and thoughts in mind, headache,and don't feel sleepy and drowsy in day then you can think that you have slept well.And on the other hand,if you have all these problems if you have not taken a sleep of about 7–8 hours then you can think that you have not been sleeping properly. Also,if you have any problems regarding proper sleep,and you feel that you can not sleep in day or night you can take help of medication. It worked for me and it will definitely be helpful to anybody. A sleep of 7–8 hours is enough for an adult,so anyone can figure out if he or she has slept well and enough or not. Hope this helps.

So here are a few tips that might help:Monitor what you eat for your last meal: A good plant-based protein source like lentils coupled with complex carbs, whole grains (rice, wheat, millets etc) good option because this triggers tryptophan in your body, and tryptophan triggers serotonin. Serotonin further triggers melatonin, which is your sleep hormone and will help you sleep better. A handful of pumpkin seeds will also help trigger melatonin.Avoid tea or coffee post 2 PM: You can replace this with chamomile tea if you still want something hot in the evening. Besides having a warm beverage, chamomile is also a natural sedative. Chamomile is widely used as a mild tranquilizer or a sleep aid. It is a great option to help you sleep better.The most important tip is to develop a sleep routine: One hour before your sleep, schedule a routine that does not include technology. Work only with things non-technology-related. This could be anything from playing with your pet to cuddling with your partner to getting your groceries and meal prep ready for the next day. The lesser the screen time, the better will be your sleep.What does science say? In a study of 60 nursing home residents, it was discovered that those who were given 400 mg of chamomile extract daily had considerably better sleep quality than those who were not. Another study of postpartum women with poor sleep quality discovered that those who drank chamomile tea for a two-week period reported generally improved sleep quality than those who did not.Trust this helps, Roshni Sanghvi"

Your body will soon start relating wakefulness with lying on bed and your sleep quality will further go down the drain.Drink a glass of milk if possible before sleep (avoid if lactose intolerant). Milk has been scientifically proven to mildly raise your serotonin levels in brain which can improve sleep.Make sure you sleep only at night. Make sure the room lighting is dull if you use night lamps. Brighter lights will stimulate your brain and will keep you awake.Exercising can improve your sleep.Some people use masturbation to get good sleep. (Dunno if it's true/helpful)Avoiding stressful thoughts during sleep will improve your sleep quality and will lead to lesser chances of nightmares, horrible dreams of your stresses.That's it! I hope this helps."
"Get up at the same time every day. If tired in the evening through late nights then go to bed early but rise at the same time each morning.

Have a milky drink or some herbal tea before bed.

Use some relaxation techniques in the evening until you can switch off."
"This is somewhat subjective by person, however:

Regular exercise will typically help sleep quality, but don't exercise immediately before bed.
Do not eat right before going to sleep
Do not drink excessively (especially before bed)
Keep TVs and other screens out of the bedroom

If you have trouble staying asleep you can try a white noise machine (or fan), but try to avoid music that you end up paying attention to."
"Put your niggling worry off your mind. This is easy said than done but this is one of the biggest problem creator when it comes to good sleep.
Have early dinner. The food when it gets digested early does not obstruct in going to sleep.
Have a relaxing time and unwind at the end of the day. Slow down things.
Having gratitude helps in releasing feel good chemicals that help in getting good night sleep."
"Eat your dinner two hours before sleep and keep it light. If you feel hungry later, you can drink milk. Drinking milk before bed helps you to get a good sleep.

Stay away from electronic devices at least an hour before sleep because they emit light and stimulate your brain. It feels like an alien when you get up after scrolling your phone for hours before sleep.

You can instead go for a walk or read a physical book or write your journal.

Just following these two things make a huge difference.

Good luck!"
"Deep breathing, and trying to keep mind thoughtless is one of the best methods to sleep. It's necessary to train your mind and this is very slow process so you have to be patient.

Have warm bath before sleeping and keep all kind of screens away from you, at least 1 hour before sleeping. Don't panic or be anxious if you can't sleep. Try to keep calm. Soothing music or certain fragrances might help but I suggest there is no need of all kind of expensive these things if you train your mind to do so."

Design your sleep environment to establish the conditions you need for sleep. Your bedroom should be cool – between 60 and 67 degrees. Your bedroom should also be free from any noise that can disturb your sleep. Finally, your bedroom should be free from any light. Check your room for noises or other distractions. This includes a bed partner's sleep disruptions such as snoring. Consider using blackout curtains, eye shades, ear plugs, ""white noise"" machines, humidifiers, fans and other devices."
"Ha! Easy answer.

What caused my best sleep EVER? Going to bed knowing I didn’t owe anyone anything; no money, no unfulfilled promises, no amends, nothing. When every one of my responsibilities are covered in full, that’s the best sleep ever.

Oh… and by the way…

It ALSO happens to be the best drug ever.

When it happens to you, you’ll know it."
"As I said sleeping is essential to life but many people suffer from sleep disorders. It maybe a nightmare or an uncomfortable mattress, or you're just maybe too stressed. Unfortunately I can't do anything about your nightmares but if you have an uncomfortable mattress I suggest that you either change it or buy a purple mattress-their firm and soft at the same time and they were designed by actual rocket scientists.

This other method might not work for some people but the method is to turn off all the lights and play a documentary in your phone, laptop etc. If you are like me and love watching horror movies then you know how hard it is to sleep, you pay attention to every little sound you hear and cannot stop staring at the mirror. But one of the most effective methods is to pray before sleeping- pray that you sleep well and pray that you are healthy the next day. After praying just keep thinking of what you will do tomorrow and soon those thoughts will turn into dreams and those dreams will turn into reality. Thanks again for looking at my answer"

"Get up early and always at the same time. Turn in no later tgan 11 pm. Eat lightly before bedtime. Take a daily walk and exercise and get plenty of light during the day. Avoid exercising after 6 pm. Keep your weight within normal limits. Obesity causes sleep apneas and slee disturbances. Eat healthy. Keep a good sleep routine. Avoid blue screens and excess light at night. Keep your room cool and well ventilated. If you are tired during the day and can afford to do it, take “a power nap.” This is 60 minute nap no later than 3 pm."

"If you go to bed and find yourself staring at the ceiling for an hour or so, just get out of bed and try to read. Not in front of a screen, mind you. Pick up a book, a magazine or something. When you do start to feel tired again, go back to bed immediately."

"Here are some things that you should avoid before going to bed. Alcohol Some people think that a glass of wine is healthy habit because it helps to keep blood pressure under control. It may be true, because red wine contains resveratrol, that may improve heart health. In 2016, researchers suggested that it could reduce the risk of heart disease. However berries and grapes also contain resveratrol, so it’s more healthy to eat them rather than drinking wine.

But don’t forget about toxicity of alcoholic drinks, that’s why it’s not a good idea to drink wine before going to bed if you want to improve the quality of your sleep. Devices Researchers say that using smart phones, e-readers, tablets and even watching television before going to bed disturbs your sleep. So if you want to be productive, mute all notification and don’t use devices before sleep. Caffeine According to studies caffeine stays in our body for almost 10–12 hours and even a small cup of coffee contains at least 80 to 120 milligrams of caffeine. Also caffeine is contained in all kinds of tea. I would recommend you to replace coffee and tea with water. After 3 weeks you would feel more alive and the quality of sleep will improve. Chocolate I have a sweet tooth and can eat the whole chocolate bar in one sitting. But I try to eat chocolate in the morning hours. Sugar rush invigorates the body and helps the brain to work more effectively. However our body doesn’t need excessive energy in the evening hours when we’re going to bed. If you feel like eating something sweet, just drink a glass of water. Lots of water Yes, I’ve said that you should drink a glass of water instead of chocolate but there is no need to drink a lot before going to sleep- it will result in unnecessary trips to the bathroom which obviously disrupt your sleep. Air the room Fresh air is important for good sleep. So while you’re brushing teeth, open the window! And in the morning you will be more productive and motivated. But this rule is better be avoided by people from Alaska or Florida. In the former case your bed would be very cold, in the later case full of lizards. Food You shouldn’t eat much before going to bed. For example, meat digests too long. So if you’re hungry, you’d better eat a vegetable salad or a dairy product. It’s easy to be successful, motivated and healthy, you should just get enough sleep and always avoid the above-mentioned things before going to bed."

"Original question: What is the trick to getting a great nights sleep?

Don’t go to bed before you’re ready to sleep - unless you like to read in bed.
Have a glass of warm milk with a bit of sugar (to taste) and no more than a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg.
When you feel ready to sleep, turn the light off, roll over, and don’t lie and ruminate.

Fall short and it can take a serious toll on your daytime energy, productivity, emotional balance, and even your weight. Yet many of us regularly toss and turn at night, struggling to get the sleep we need. Getting a good night’s sleep may seem like an impossible goal when you’re wide awake at 3 a.m., but you have much more control over the quality of your sleep than you probably realize. Just as the way you feel during your waking hours often hinges on how well you sleep at night, so the cure for sleep difficulties can often be found in your daily routine. Unhealthy daytime habits and lifestyle choices can leave you tossing and turning at night and adversely affect your mood, brain and heart health, immune system, creativity, vitality, and weight. But by experimenting with the following tips, you can enjoy better sleep at night, boost your health, and improve how you think and feel during the day.Keep in sync with your body’s natural sleep-wake cycleGetting in sync with your body’s natural sleep-wake cycle, or circadian rhythm, is one of the most important strategies for sleeping better. If you keep a regular sleep-wake schedule, you’ll feel much more refreshed and energized than if you sleep the same number of hours at different times, even if you only alter your sleep schedule by an hour or two. Try to go to sleep and get up at the same time every day. This helps set your body’s internal clock and optimize the quality of your sleep. Choose a bed time when you normally feel tired, so that you don’t toss and turn. If you’re getting enough sleep, you should wake up naturally without an alarm. If you need an alarm clock, you may need an earlier bedtime. Avoid sleeping in even on weekends. The more your weekend/weekday sleep schedules differ, the worse the jetlag-like symptoms you’ll experience. If you need to make up for a late night, opt for a daytime nap rather than sleeping in. This allows you to pay off your sleep debt without disturbing your natural sleep-wake rhythm. Be smart about napping. While napping is a good way to make up for lost sleep, if you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at night, napping can make things worse. Limit naps to 15 to 20 minutes in the early afternoon. Fight after-dinner drowsiness. If you get sleepy way before your bedtime, get off the couch and do something mildly stimulating, such as washing the dishes, calling a friend, or getting clothes ready for the next day. If you give in to the drowsiness, you may wake up later in the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. 2. Control your exposure to light Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone controlled by light exposure that helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle. Your brain secretes more melatonin when it’s dark making you sleepy and less when it’s light making you more alert. However, many aspects of modern life can alter your body’s production of melatonin and shift your circadian rhythm. Here’s how to influence your exposure to light: During the day Expose yourself to bright sunlight in the morning. The closer to the time you get up, the better. Have your coffee outside, for example, or eat breakfast by a sunny window. The light on your face will help you wake up Spend more time outside during daylight. Take your work breaks outside in sunlight, exercise outside, or walk your dog during the day instead of at night. Let as much natural light into your home or workspace as possible. Keep curtains and blinds open during the day, and try to move your desk closer to the window. If necessary, use a light therapy box. This simulates sunshine and can be especially useful during short winter days. At night Avoid bright screens within 1-2 hours of your bedtime. The blue light emitted by your phone, tablet, computer, or TV is especially disruptive. You can minimize the impact by using devices with smaller screens, turning the brightness down, or using light-altering software such as f.lux. Say no to late-night television. Not only does the light from a TV suppress melatonin, but many programs are stimulating rather than relaxing. Try listening to music or audio books instead. Don’t read with backlit devices. Tablets that are backlit are more disruptive than e- readers that don’t have their own light source. When it’s time to sleep, make sure the room is dark. Use heavy curtains or shades to block light from windows, or try a sleep mask. Also consider covering up electronics that emit light. Keep the lights down if you get up during the night. If you need some light to move around safely, try installing a dim nightlight in the hall or bathroom or using a small flashlight. This will make it easier for you to fall back to sleep. 3. Exercise during the day People who exercise regularly sleep better at night and feel less sleepy during the day. Regular exercise also improves the symptoms of insomnia and sleep apnea and increases the amount of time you spend in the deep, restorative stages of sleep. The more vigorously you exercise, the more powerful the sleep benefits. But even light exercise such as walking for just 10 minutes a day improves sleep quality. It can take several months of regular activity before you experience the full sleep- promoting effects. So be patient and focus on building an exercise habit that sticks. For better sleep, time your exercise right Exercise speeds up your metabolism, elevates body temperature, and stimulates hormones such as cortisol. This isn’t a problem if you’re exercising in the morning or afternoon, but too close to bed and it can interfere with sleep. Try to finish moderate to vigorous workouts at least three hours before bedtime. If you’re still experiencing sleep difficulties, move your workouts even earlier. Relaxing, low-impact exercises such as yoga or gentle stretching in the evening can help promote sleep. 4. Be smart about what you eat and drink Your daytime eating habits play a role in how well you sleep, especially in the hours before bedtime. Limit caffeine and nicotine. You might be surprised to know that caffeine can cause sleep problems up to ten to twelve hours after drinking it! Similarly, smoking is another stimulant that can disrupt your sleep, especially if you smoke close to bedtime. Avoid big meals at night. Try to make dinnertime earlier in the evening, and avoid heavy, rich foods within two hours of bed. Spicy or acidic foods can cause stomach trouble and heartburn. Avoid alcohol before bed. While a nightcap may help you relax, it interferes with your sleep cycle once you’re out. Avoid drinking too many liquids in the evening. Drinking lots of fluids may result in frequent bathroom trips throughout the night. Cut back on sugary foods and refined carbs. Eating lots of sugar and refined carbs such as white bread, white rice, and pasta during the day can trigger wakefulness at night and pull you out of the deep, restorative stages of sleep. Nighttime snacks may help you to sleep For some people, a light snack before bed can help promote sleep. For others, eating before bed leads to indigestion and makes sleeping more difficult. If you need a bedtime snack, try: . Half a turkey sandwich. . Milk or yogurt. . A banana. 5. Wind down and clear your head Do you often find yourself unable to get to sleep or regularly waking up night after night? Residual stress, worry, and anger from your day can make it very difficult to sleep well. Taking steps to manage your overall stress levels and learning how to curb the worry habit can make it easier to unwind at night. You can also try developing a relaxing bedtime ritual to help you prepare your mind for sleep, such as practicing a relaxation technique, taking a warm bath, or dimming the lights and listening to soft music or an audiobook. Problems clearing your head at night can also stem from your daytime habits. The more overstimulated your brain becomes during the day, the harder it can be to slow down and unwind at night. Maybe, like many of us, you’re constantly interrupting tasks during the day to check your phone, email, or social media. Then when it comes to getting to sleep at night, your brain is so accustomed to seeking fresh stimulation, it becomes difficult to unwind. Help yourself by setting aside specific times during the day for checking your phone and social media and, as much as possible, try to focus on one task at a time. You’ll be better able to calm your mind at bedtime. 6. Improve your sleep environment A peaceful bedtime routine sends a powerful signal to your brain that it’s time to wind down and let go of the day’s stresses. Sometimes even small changes to your environment can make a big difference to your quality of sleep. Keep your room dark, cool, and quiet Keep noise down. If you can’t avoid or eliminate noise from neighbors, traffic, or other people in your household, try masking it with a fan or sound machine. Earplugs may also help. Keep your room cool. Most people sleep best in a slightly cool room (around 65° F or 18° C) with adequate ventilation. A bedroom that is too hot or too cold can interfere with quality sleep. Make sure your bed is comfortable. Your bed covers should leave you enough room to stretch and turn comfortably without becoming tangled. If you often wake up with a sore back or an aching neck, you may need to experiment with different levels of mattress firmness, foam toppers, and pillows that provide more or less support. Reserve your bed for sleeping and sex. By not working, watching TV, or using your phone, tablet, or computer in bed, your brain will associate the bedroom with just sleep and sex, which makes it easier to wind down at night. Hope this helped Best Regards, Mohamad."

"Dominic Novielli's answer to What do you do when you are struggling to fall asleep?

I have used these to good effect. Also, install f.lux
 on your screens to reduce the blue light which interferes with melatonin production. It’s free and does not download with anything else. And keep away from sweets in the evening or any food with a high glycemic index close to bedtime.

Good Health !"

"Going to bed around the same time every night. This will create a good habitual pattern.

Avoiding snoozing and getting up as soon as your alarm rings. This will prevent you from being groggy in the morning.

Not eating at least 3 hours before you go to bed. This will help you fall asleep faster."
"To help me sleep I take melatonin. It’s over the counter, not perscription, and if your having trouble sleeping I don’t see the harm. Plus, there is chewable melatonin and some are even plant based. Also, it keeps you asleep, and makes you fall asleep fast. And, you cans still wake up in the morning without wanting to die. It’s a win win situation."

It allows your body to rejuvenate its hardworking cells and restore energy that you need for the following day. Unfortunately, the harsh demands of daily life lead us to unwittingly form habits that make it hard for us to sleep soundly. Sleep deprivation is one of the most dreaded health issues experienced by hardworking adults, yet based on a research done in 2014 by the Centers for Disease and Control, 1 out of 3 American adults get fewer snooze time based on what is recommended for their age group. ""SLEEP DEPRIVATION IS ONE OF THE MOST DREADED HEALTH ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY HARDWORKING ADULTS"" Getting less sleep than what we need makes us feel groggy throughout the day, which leads to unwanted unproductivity. It also leads to weight gain, moodiness, problems with concentration, and worse, a higher risk for diabetes and heart disease. If you’re tired of constantly having a hard time getting a good night’s sleep, here are five tried-and-tested tips that you can try to get your circadian rhythm back on its feet. 1. Keep Electronic Devices Away From Your Bed With the existence of portable devices such as smartphones and laptops, technology has become an integral part of our lives as these gadgets allow us to do work and interact with friends with just a few clicks. Come bedtime, it’s often very tempting to check your phone or laptop before you hit the hay. Aside from this usually leading to another hour of scrolling down your newsfeed (despite promising to yourself that you’ll sleep after 15 minutes) the real danger here is the blue light emitted by your phone or laptop. A lot of studies have been published that warns us of the dangers of blue light exposure. Melatonin is the sleep-inducing hormone released by your body to prepare for bed time, and research shows that blue light suppresses the production of melatonin more than any type of artificial light. ""STAY AWAY FROM BLUE LIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED."" It’s almost impossible to avoid artificial light these days, but scientists recommend staying away from blue light 30 to 60 minutes before going to bed. Your Facebook status can wait another day! 2. Keep a Diary Some people find themselves tossing and toiling in their sheets the entire night, haunted by millions of thoughts running in their heads. If this sounds all too familiar to you, perhaps it’s time to stop keeping all those thoughts to yourself. An effective way to end this is to start a habit of keeping a diary: this is a harmless way of detoxifying your brain from your thoughts and worries. Writing down on your diary every night is also a healthier replacement for the devices that you’re used to fidgeting with before sleeping, thus you’ll be hitting two birds with one stone. This is scientifically proven as well - research shows that people who keep a journal experience enhancement in immune function, drops in blood pressure, and an overall decrease in stress. If bad thoughts keep you awake, perhaps it’s time to pick up a pen and start the good habit of writing on a diary before you sleep. 3. Develop a Regular Sleep Schedule Believe it or not, the body has its own clock which keeps a schedule of your daily activities. This is called the Circadian Rhythm (your ‘body clock’), the 24-hour cycle of your physiological processes. You can feel this whenever you’re feeling energized in the morning, or drowsy whenever bedtime is only a few hours away. Following your body clock is vital for a healthy and happy disposition in your daily life. However, you can ruin this clock by constantly sleeping past your bedtime or napping excessively during daylight hours. This leads to a lot of problems: feeling tired when it’s not even close to bedtime, difficulties sleeping, and if your clock is continuously disrupted, it can lead to insomnia. These small symptoms will eventually lead to lifelong diseases you’ll regret later in life, as chronic insomnia can lead to psychological, physiological problems, and an increased chance of sudden death. ""SET A STRICT BEDTIME SCHEDULE."" If you want to stop or prevent these symptoms, you can start by setting a strict bedtime schedule, allotting time only for sleeping and nothing else. Napping is okay in moderation, but doing so for more than an hour can really destroy your body clock. If you become more observant of your body clock, you’ll eventually feel the difference by having plentiful energy throughout the day! 4. Cut Down Your Caffeine Intake Some people run on coffee - as someone once told me, ‘don’t talk to me until I’ve had my coffee!’ I can’t blame her though, a good cup of joe is undeniably tasty, and it gives you that kick that really helps you start your day. Coffee has a lot of benefits for your body as well: it boosts your metabolism, increases your mood, and it is scientifically proven to make you live longer in general. But what comes after a coffee high is the dreadful coffee crash: a short period of time when you suddenly feel drowsy, dizzy, or anxious. Hold that thought of having another cup though; it actually does more harm to you than a short coffee crash. Too much caffeine will keep you up and you’ll have difficulty trying to sleep. Studies show that drinking caffeine 6 hours before bedtime takes away an hour of bedtime. Thus you can still enjoy your coffee, but make sure to plan ahead to ensure a good night’s sleep. The same applies to sugary food and drinks, like coke and candy bars - it’s best to avoid these kinds of food before bedtime along with caffeine. 5. Exercise Regularly Regular exercise has too many benefits to ignore. It can lead to weight loss, clearer skin, better immune system, and so much more… which includes better sleep during nighttime. Exercise helps you reduce stress and anxiety, both of which can cause difficulty when you’re trying to sleep. It also helps you deplete your energy in which your body will be craving to restore after an exhilarating session at the gym. The sudden dip in body temperature after exercise will make you feel drowsy, too. If you’re trying to exercise to specifically improve your sleep, make sure to do it five to six hours before you plan to sleep. If you exercise too close to bedtime, you’ll find yourself energized until its way past your bedtime. So if you haven’t started doing regular exercise yet, it’s better late than never - you’ll be healthier in the long run! So before you succumb to taking sleep-inducing medication, it wouldn’t hurt to try and see if these inexpensive and natural tips can help you finally get a good night’s sleep. A little discipline goes a long way, and your body will thank you for it!"

"Sleep troubles depend on the person, but the most common prescription for good sleep is a consistent routine that involves waking at the same time each day, eating healthy, getting at least 30 minutes of exercise a day (do not exercise within 3 hours of bed) and not consuming stimulants like caffeine before bed.

Meditation and/or emotional release therapy can help! Exercise and good diet also.

I like to brush my teeth before going to bed, but I do not think I have ever seen that as a suggestion to help with sleep. I hope you find something that works for you."
"It’s best to be relaxed, tired and clear of any anxieties on your mind. Also there should be break between your last meal of the day and when you go to sleep. A comfortable position [mine is on my left side, head on a pillow so that there is no strain on my neck muscles], NO TV or other distractions.

I often advised children who complain of “bad dreams” to turn over the pillow, because the good dreams are on the other side. It really works too."

No excitement before bed. Make sure you have a good mattress and eat your last meal of the day well before going to bed. Too much food in your stomach disturbs your sleep and also tends to make you fat. Meditate and visualise an icon of your deity if you have one. Otherwise select a beautiful landscape for your icon. Say a mantra while you lie there waiting for sleep. Mantras are sacred words - prayers. If you are not religious select the best verse of your favourite poem. Say it over and over again.

"Live an overall healthy life and maintaining a low level of stress helps tremendously. I was on ambien for a while, but it stopped working. I started improving my life in other ways, and now I sleep really well.

I feel others live a healthier life by getting toxins out of their home and switch to healthier, budget-friendly products. Let me know if this is something you are open to learning more about."
"For a good sleep you require a tired mind or body. If you are a sitting duck then it’s difficult. More so you don’t need to emphasise more on sleep, just simply after taking your dinner go to bed and try to read something and you will get a good sleep. But if you are bothered for a long time then see a doctor."

Not only does the light from a TV suppress melatonin, but many programs are stimulating rather than relaxing. Try listening to music or audio books instead. 5. EXERCISE People who exercise regularly sleep better at night and feel less sleepy during the day. Regular exercise also improves the symptoms of insomnia and sleep apnea and increases the amount of time you spend in the deep, restorative stages of sleep. 6.Your daytime eating habits play a role in how well you sleep, especially in the hours before bedtime.Limit caffeine and nicotine. You might be surprised to know that caffeine can cause sleep problems up to ten to twelve hours after drinking it! Similarly, smoking is another stimulant that can disrupt your sleep, especially if you smoke close to bedtime."
"""Sleep is that golden key that ties health and our bodies together."" ― Thomas DekkerThe Different Stages of Sleep According to the National Sleep Foundation, you may need to sleep for seven to nine hours per night.[1] Despite having enough sleep, have you ever felt tired in the morning? Low-quality sleep may be your cause. During sleep, your brain goes into sleep cycles that alternate between non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) and rapid eye movement (REM).

For non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from light sleep (stage 1) to deep slow-wave sleep (stage 3 and 4). Initially, the sleep cycle starts with stage 1 of non-REM sleep, followed by stage 2, 3, and 4 of non-REM sleep and finally reaching REM sleep, which lasts about 90 minutes. Each subsequent sleep cycles last about 120 minutes but with longer length of REM sleep.Sleep cycle, REM indicated in red. The Importance of Sleep Each stage of sleep is key to fulfilling the physiological and neurological functions of a healthy body and mind. If any of the sleep stages are missed or sleep is interrupted, some physiological functions won't be performed. Hence you may feel tired and groggy despite sleeping enough hours. When you maximize REM sleep, all other stages will also be optimized. During sleep, the body also goes into recovery and rebuilding mode by executing the following:Rebuilds musclesRemoves toxins in the brain such as beta amyloidSynthesizes essential hormonesBoosts immune functionConsolidates memoryWithout sufficient sleep, your body will have increased levels of cortisol, a stress hormone in the body.

The result was insomnia. How embarrassing, I thought. Being a yoga teacher, Ayurvedic practitioner and Bio-Energy practitioner, surely I had picked up some tools to help me sleep. While I have a plethora of tools to work with, what I found was that insomnia has a deep root. Until the root cause is addressed the endless tossing and turning will prevail. In Ayurveda, insomnia is considered a vata condition. Vata is wind, movement, change, instability, cold, dry, light. In order to reverse the insomnia, the opposite qualities must be experienced: stillness, stability, grounded, warm, unctuous, heavy. The nervous system has been derailed and the five vayus/prana are not flowing properly, causing sleeplessness. With too much stress, anxiety and over-thinking, all of the prana moves upwards into the head, gets stuck and there you are staring at the ceiling all night long. Been there? Try these things. Not just once but get into a habit so that you adjust your relationship to sleep: No Caffeine / sugar / stimulants Be kind to your delicate nervous system and avoid these sleep-suckers. If you must indulge, do so in the morning time and certainly not after 3:00 li.m. Drink a cup of milk That's right, just like your Grandma used to make you before bed. Boil a cup of organic milk (or almond milk) with ¼ tsp of nutmeg. Lavender essential oil Sprinkle a few drops of this pure essential oil onto your pillow or a dab onto your temples before bed. Oil your feet Yep, you heard that correctly. Rub some cold pressed organic sesame oil onto the soles of your feet before you cozy up under the covers (be sure to slip on some cotton socks so you don't get oil on your sheets). Wind down At least one hour before bed, get off your computer, away from the TV and turn off bright lights. Get your nervous system in the mood for sleep. Light a candle. Journal. Relax. Meditation You knew that was coming didn't you? It's true, meditation is the panacea for uncluttering the mind and releasing all of the conscious and subconscious garbage we carry around. Chamomile tea Simple. Easy. Have a cup in the evening instead of reaching for that glass of wine or stimulating tea. Abhyanga Say what? This is the Ayurvedic oil massage. Taking up this daily practice will change your life. Warm up some sesame oil (baby bottle style) and massage it into your body, working from the extremities in to your heart. Let this oil soak into the skin for 10-20 minutes before having a warm shower or bath. Ladies, avoid this practice on your menstrual cycle. Exercise You don't have to do a half-marathon every day but make sure you are active, working your muscles and getting your heart rate up. Take the stairs, walk to the store. Do yoga. Breathe But breathe how? Deep, abdominal breaths are super but my favorite pranayama – the king of pranayama practices – is nadi shodhana or alternate nostril breathing. Choose either practice and do it nightly like your sleep depends on it. Don't underestimate these simple practices. Simultaneously, unearth the deeper disturbances in your life – at work, in relationships, unresolved emotions or trauma. Getting a good night's sleep is crucial to your health, well-being and the ability to experience joy and peace in your life. - See more at: http://www.gaiamtv.com/article/10-ayurvedic-tips-deep-and-restful-sleep#sthash.vJaxUrAc.dpuf"

No TV, radio, MP3’s or phone.Forget anything that happened today or may happen tomorrow. Let those things take care of themselves. Make up a short story about one of your favorite TV shows or book characters, or make up a story out of your imagination. Bedtime stories are not just for kids any more! :D"
Work throughout the day and be busy in work. Definitely you'll have great night sleep.
"I would recommend staying away from electronics for 1–2 hours before bed, taking melatonin if you have trouble falling asleep, and listening to calming, classical music before bed."
"Sleep is disturbed in many ways…

1 if you eat too much, too late…

2. If you are too much stressed…

3 if you fear of people knock your doors in night for money you borrowed.

4 if you are afraid that your extramarital affair or some thing else you did would get caught soon…

I f you are not in above list…and you work hard in the day, you eat moderately, you are enthusiastic for next morning…then sleep come automatically.

Take a leisure walk before sleeping or listen to melodies - is good to get easy sleep."
"Glycine & magnesium about 1 hour before bed.
Blue light filter on computer.
Minimal use of lights and computers after 7pm"
"Work hard and do exercise.

Take up your passion and you will find your sleep."
"I use a CPAP machine. It has been a lifesaver.

I’ve done Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia, and I strongly recommend it.

However - I’m on Quora now because I can’t sleep."

"Get rid of soda pop, coffee, tea. And sugars. Also, no white bread either, it turns to sugar.

Any booze or beer, or wine or whiskey will interfere with sleep.

Many non prescription medications and other drugs will interfere with your sleep also.

Taking these things anytime durning the day will keep you awake at night."
"Be active during the day, and exercise. Those are a couple of daytime things you can do.

"Make your room as dark as possible. Get a comfortable mattress (I like foam but whatever you like). Avoid or limit screen time via computer, phone, tv, put F.lux on your computer. Eat a little something before bed, like 100–200 calories.

Listen to isochronic tones or binaural beats, they enhance sleep as well. Read, meditate before sleep, also you can use an acupressure mat like the one sold by Bulletproof to relax tension in muscles all across your body."
"A bit of a Yoga helps.

Try child pose. This pose is very relaxing and don’t think much. This Yoga pose works like a charm.

Sleep well :)"
"What improved my sleep life was being diagnosed with sleep apnoea and being prescribed a CPAP machine. Each year I go to the Sleep technician and my Respiratory physician and obtain a readout of my sleep.

That way they know and I know that my therapy is working, that I am much less likely to develop heart problems later and that, under driving laws in South Australia that I can continue to hold a driver’s license.

The latter two pieces of news also help me sleep well !!"

I just happen to have an answer all polished up for someone else. They gave as much information as you did. Find the most comfortable place for you to sleep. I use a medium hard, adjustable bed.

They mostly work well, here is one of many techniques Fall-Asleep-Right-Away- . For it to work well, you have to practice it strictly for at least a week. Any other technique will require at least as much practice, and most of them, much more. Be sure the room is reasonably dark (My room has skylights without drapes, so I put a towel over my head. I can do this because I use a CPAP and the towel doesn’t hinder my breathing.) Make yourself a going to bed routine, and follow it ritualistically. This gives your subconscious a cue that it is time to sleep. The non-verbal half of your brain has a lot to do with good sleep. You will find that at the end of the routine, you are yawning and feeling very sleepy. Eat some slow carbs just before going to bed. A bowl of raisin bran or granola, or even a bowl of oatmeal or Mac & Cheese if you are into cooking. This will keep you from having a blood sugar low in the middle of the night. Get at least 7 hours of sleep. Go to bed early enough to get that. Jump out of bed when you naturally wake around your alarm time, don’t go back to sleep. If you are awakened by the alarm, don’t hit “snooze” jump up and start your morning routine. You need to establish a waking up routine, relieve your bodily needs, shower (or wash your face, if you don’t shower in the morning), brush your teeth (if you have them, otherwise put them in), comb your hair (if you have any). dress for the day, and go get a cup of coffee. You can preset a number of things for the routine the night before. With this proven method the best sleep of your life lies before you. You have but to seize the opportunity. Sleep well, and prosper."

And psychologically when you pray to your god in whom you believe will make you think or feel that he will take care of your problems and making you calm and forget about the problems in your life when going to bed and have a good sleep.Also I used to read Hanuman Chalisa before sleeping which made me “brave” enough to fight any fears or nightmares I used to have.(Worked for me at least)Be more active physically during day time and find some time half an hour or hour for walking and doing exercise which will make you tired enough to prevent waking up in the middle of the night.Drink warm milk with turmeric to sooth yourself one hour ahead going to bed.Do not eat heavy meals in the night and try to eat two hours before going to bed and walk around after taking dinner for better digestion and to avoid heavy stomach.Do not drink Tea/Coffee/aerated/energy drinks because they contain caffeine that keeps you awaken.

Everyday morning i use to check online for some interview and start from my home with a bag that has lunch and my file. I attend some interview in the morning(out of which most of them were consultancies) and then go for part-time job in the city itself. After a point of time i was bored of giving interviews to consultancies and started going for part time job alone. Initially, we were going for interviews in batches later the number reduced and finally only me and my other friend who was doing part time job with me were left. All others were placed in big & small software companies. Then a point came where i decided i will do any kind of job not necessarily software job. And few days later, one of my friend sent an sms about jobs in Amazon. I called and checked with him if it was true or just a forwarded msg. He said it was sent by his cousin and it is true. So i went for the interview with my friend. I saw a huge crowd of people standing in front of Amazon office. Looking at the crowd I said we will not get this job, lets leave ;) My friend forced me to stay and made sure i attend the Interview. After the interview, i din’t know whether to feel happy or sad. I was selected for the job and my friend did not get selected. He was always happy that at least one us got job and asked me to give treat. At that point of time, I was ready to give anything he asks. An unforgettable day."

Its not that I did not have best sleep before that, I did have many serene and peaceful nights of sleep. I think there comes a career aspect in almost all the individual lives. No matter from which background/field we belong to and Education is not an excuse in the career aspect. Here is a small glimpse of my career advancement which helped me to have a sound sleep from a long time. I finished my Masters in Embedded Systems from one of the most reputed Private Universities i.e Manipal University. During my Internship period I neither had good work nor the guarantee of getting converted in that company as a permanent employee. As a result of this I was bit worried and started to apply jobs outside from Dec-2015. Back then I was getting least calls for attending the interviews. Since I had my education loan debt to be cleared I was even more concerned about my career and getting a job. Because of this I had some bad daily schedule and sleeping habits. Sometimes my sleeping habits were as bad as, I used to sleep at 3/4 AM in the morning thinking about my future and career. Perhaps this is the same scenario with many grads and post grads. Finally I was fortunate enough to get an Interview in the month of March. Though the Interview went well in my very first interview for a reputed company,after clearing almost all the rounds, I received a mail on my birthday saying that I was not selected which was more painful. I was just pretending that I was okay on that particular day. Probably that was the time when I was born under a lucky star, I got another opportunity to attend the Interview. Since I prepared well for the previous company’s interview, this interview was like a cake walk for me. I gave my full potential and I was through the Interview and finally I got my first job in one of the most reputed company of all time. I received my offer letter on 27th-April-2016. I was so ecstatic on that day and probably I had my best sleep after a long time . Then the best sleep nights followed as the days rolled. Here I would like to mention a Kannada quote “ಚಿಂತೆ ಇಲ್ಲದವನಿಗೆ ಸಂತೆಯಲ್ಲೂ ನಿದ್ದೆ” which means if we do not have worries/tensions in life we will get sound sleep even in the market. It holds good for each and every individual on this Universe, if we are free from problems/worries then there is no need to worry about best sleep as such, it will automatically lead to have best sleep. Cheers..:) Thanks A2A."

"Sleeping in the birth suit. Benefits-Boost Your Love LifePeople who sleep in the buff have happier love lives, according to a survey of 1,000 British adults by a bed sheet company this year. This is not totally surprising, but 57 percent of nude sleepers were happy with their relationship, compared with 48 percent of pajama wearers. It’s not that taking each other’s clothes off isn’t sexy or fun, it’s just that being naked kind of takes the middleman out of the equation. Pardon the expression, unless there truly is a middleman in your bed—in which case, carry on.Better Sleep QualityIn ordContinue ReadingSleeping in the birth suit.

This is not totally surprising, but 57 percent of nude sleepers were happy with their relationship, compared with 48 percent of pajama wearers. It’s not that taking each other’s clothes off isn’t sexy or fun, it’s just that being naked kind of takes the middleman out of the equation. Pardon the expression, unless there truly is a middleman in your bed—in which case, carry on.Better Sleep QualityIn order to fall asleep, your core body temperature needs to drop by about half a degree. And in order to stay asleep, that ideal body temperature needs to be regulated, otherwise your brain will wake itself up to see why you’re so godforsakenly hot.The advantage of sleeping naked is that it’s easier for your body to cool down quicker, and to maintain that lower body temperature your brain wants to achieve. Disrupted sleep from being too hot doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get less overall sleep, but it does mean you’ll have less deep, restorative sleep, which is key for memory consolidation and cell repair. So, think twice about swaddling yourself in quilts and sweatshirts (it’s called a sweatshirt for a reason), especially if you’re partner is in bed with you. You have a perfectly good heat source mere inches away; cozy up when you need warmth and then retreat to your side of the bed when you’re arm starts sweating on theirs. It’s a flawless system, really. Burn More CaloriesBrown fat has gained more notice in recent news, mostly for its ability to produce 300 times more heat than any other organ in your body. While ordinary white body fat (bad fat) piles on when we eat more calories than we burn, brown fat (good fat) generates heat, thusly burning that energy stored in white fat. Though brown fat is common in babies--it’s what keeps them warm--studies have found that we have a small amount in our necks, too. A U.S. study in the journal Diabetes found that sleeping in a cold bedroom could activate brown fat in adults. In the study, five healthy young men slept in a climate-controlled bedroom for four months. In the first month, the room was kept at 74 degrees Fahrenheit, lowered to 66 degrees Fahrenheit in the second, brought back to 74 degrees Fahrenheit in the third, and raised to 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the fourth. After the second month of sleeping at 66 degrees Fahrenheit, the men had almost doubled their volumes of brown fat. They burned more calories throughout the day—though not enough to lose weight—and their insulin sensitivity improved. Sleeping naked or in cooler temperatures (or both!) can help to activate brown fat, so this is really a no-brainer. Lower Blood PressureLaying in bed with your partner, naked, is found to generate a boost in oxytocin, a hormone shown to have many health benefits. Skin-to-skin contact sends impulses to the brain, triggering the release of oxytocin, which has a protective effect on the heart, as it lowers blood pressure, boosts the immune system and reduces anxiety. As if you needed another reason to get naked with your partner in bed.Source:http://www.mensfitness.com/life/4-benefits-sleeping-naked"

"I think a bedroom with good sound-proof condition, a very comfortable bed and clean environment with faint fragrance will contribute to get a better quality sleep."
"The best techniques… to getting a better quality sleep are really quite simple.
1. Turn off all electronic devices at least one hour before you want to sleep. (this will give your brain a chance to slow down and get into sleep mode.)

2. Have a warm drink about 20 min before sleep. This will relax you and help you to fall asleep.
3. Have some white noise in the background. (a fan works well)

These are my techniques for a great quality sleep."

"Well start reading more about Lucid Dreaming and its wonders.  The curiosity and willingness to learn about it will make u sleep. Been there , tried that and it works."
Get up early in the morning at 6. Then keep yourself busy with physical activities. Work out in a gym and tire yourself before going to bed. This will surely induce sleep. Maintain this routine for a while till your body adjusts to this cycle.
"Maintaining a regular routine will definitely help you with sleep disorders. Wake up early , get some exercise done, be busy through out the day and avoid sleeping . By doing these you feel tired at the end of the day and it helps in getting a restful sleep. Taking a glass of warm milk with honey before going to bed also helps in getting a good nights sleep.
I hope it helps !"

"Dear Friend

Keep a regular schedule at bed timing and dinner and make it a routine
Set a bedtime that is early enough for you to get at least 7–8 hours of sleep.
If you didn’t get sleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed.
Establish relaxing bedtime rituals like reading books, listening to songs, pranayama, meditation or a pleasant interaction. but kindly avoid any kind of LED light such as Television or Laptop
and so keep an alarm on same time through out the week including the weekend, with mild sound rather than so loud to break your sleep giving you a surprise headache

that's it

thank you"
"I saw a beautiful girl who used to stay in front of my house as a paying guest with five other girls. She was so alluring, so captivating that I used stand in balcony for hours to get just one glance of her. I tried to talk to her but she ignored but later things went well and even she started liking me. Here's the irony, she was two years elder to me and she had a boyfriend with a relationship of six years. He used to live in Europe.

I took her somewhere, where nobody could see us. I told her, I am very tired today and she allowed me to sleep in her arms(all this happened in my car). I slept for 5–10 minutes, but that was the best sleep in my whole life."
"Well had to go anonymous. The best sleep i ever had was after i smoked idk 4–5 joints of marijuana with my friends. Best sleep ever. Woke up 15 hours later!!

Though was the last time i smoked pot but worth it."
It has to be the night before the day I was hospitalised to deliver my elder one. Mine was an induced labor and so I knew before hand the date when I was to be hospitalized for the delivery. Everybody had warned me that sleep is history once you are a mother. My elder one was born after 5 years of marriage. Not that I did not want to start a family before that. It's just that fate had other plans for me. I had TB which despite of treatments kept relapsing. I was strictly warned against getting pregnant when my medication was on.

I had TB which despite of treatments kept relapsing. I was strictly warned against getting pregnant when my medication was on. Once the docs gave me a green signal….we just wanted to start our family. My husband was immensely supportive of me throughout my medication stage. He loves babies but not even once did he made me feel that my medical condition is snatching away this happiness from him. Finally the TB had to bow down…. I got pregnant and all this was followed by nine blissful months of my life. That night…the night before hospitalization...we just held hands..lay there in the dark.. I couldn't help but think about all that had happened. At the same time the excitement of what was about to happen. I slowly drifted into sleep. And I slept like a baby just holding my husband's hand.

Make it dark, clean and well ventilated. Please keep the room with the right temperature. Make sure you have enough blankets and soft pillows with a comfortable environment. Tip 2 – Avoid caffeine, alcohol and tobacco Of course, this does not mean that you will completely bid farewell to these bad habits, we just suggest that you stay away from them a few hours before going to bed. Caffeine-containing beverages, such as coffee, tea, soda and chocolate, can cause the excitement of human nerves, which in turn affect sleep quality. Alcohol, though to some extent, makes people sleepy, but this drowsiness does not last throughout the night, and alcohol can act as a tranquilizer, but as the alcohol concentration in the body drops, our sleep will be affected by interference. Tip 3 – Wear PEGASI blue light sleep glasses PEGASI sleepy glasses are your life’s life-saving straw, PEGASI intelligent sleep glasses are mainly for symptoms: difficult in sleeping, getting up, more dreams, less sleep, biological clock disorder and other drowsy, fatigue, poor memory, Energy can not be concentrated or unresponsive, etc. Tip 4 – Regular exercise For the white collar in the office, the physical movement is essential. According to the survey, those who often exercise in the quality of sleep is significantly better than those who do not exercise, and less the phenomenon of insomnia. Keep your daily activities for 20 minutes every day, so that your body will be in a state of excitement and he will feel tired and rest in the evening. Tip 5 – have a good schedule Life can not be tedious, but the body has a soft spot for strict timing. Try to get up and bed at the same time every day, do not indulge yourself even on weekends. Carefully estimate their own daily sleep time, and then develop a detailed schedule, I believe your body will like this rigorous schedule. Tip 6 – develop the correct understanding of the bed There is only one function of the bed, that is sleep. Many people like to study and work in bed, or watch TV, and even eat, this will affect your subconscious, the bed function of the wrong understanding. Also do not watch TV or read for more than 30 minutes before you sleep. If so, your spirit will continue to be in a state of excitement. The best sleep state is nothing to think about. Tips 7 – hot milk or herbal tea Milk in the calcium can help the body to better relax, if it is hot milk effect is better. But perhaps not everyone likes the taste of milk, so they can choose herbal tea, these tea specifically for the manufacture of sleep, it is great helpful to relax and improve the quality of sleep . Tip 8 – Meditation Behavioral Therapy This therapy can be used alone or in combination with a prescription drug from a doctor. Meditation therapy consists of two components, namely meditation and action, which will help you to solve the mental and physical problems, so as to avoid the occurrence of insomnia. Tip 9 – Relax the body, massage, hot tub A hot tub is the most appropriate for you and your body, but you know it will also improve your sleep quality.

I wanted to be a good doctor then..cardiologist to be specific..wanted to save lives..wanted to have the satisfaction of increasing the life span of a patient nearing death. But unfortunately I could not get through the mbbs entrace exam and that was the beginning of the sleepless nights, low confidence and low self esteem. I stopped going out and being social, started being aloof and frustrated. The thought that my dreams were shattered made my every second feel worthless, the disappointment on my parents face was killing me every second. I could not handle such rush of varied emotions at a tender age of 17. I constantly felt like a loser. I wanted to drop for an year but my parents did not allow me to do so. Unwillingly and half heartedly I joined a reputed college at my place to pursue b.pharm. I hardly had any interest to study but the fear of failure in life made me get through all the 4 years of b.pharm. Having very less career options for graduates I decided to go for masters. I qualified gpat and got into a national institute which changed my life forever. I met the love of my life there. We together wanted to pursue phD. But life had other plans. We could not get through the second step of the PhD interview and once again a ray of Hope which I was seeing was gone. My dreams broke for the second time. Not wanting to be a burden for my family, I joined a small firm with a very low package at a time when all my classmates were placed in big mnc. My low confidence returned and refused to leave me. I started preparing for the PhD entrance while continuing with my job. I uesd to work 10 hrs perday and study for 2hrs. I attend many PhD program interview but the reservation system, recommendations and back door entries snatched my dream of pursing PhD. Today after 6 years of feelling guilty and worthless, I got admission into the same national college as a PhD scholar and today I had the best sleep. My soul feels satisfied and full. I feel I am capable of doing many things. I can't wait to complete this course and earn to doctrate and bring back the smile and proudness on my parents face."

"I once had to write an essay (in German) on the subject of sleeplessness and my research taught me the following, which I have found to be very useful advice: Your room should be dark Do not read just before bed, unless it is something very boring that will make you sleepy! Also, don’t watch action movies or car crash compilations on YouTube! Our brains switch off when bored. If you have difficulty getting to sleep, imagine you are in a very boring lecture or waiting for the curtain to go up in a theatre.

Tell each muscle to relax and feel heavy."

Slept 13 - 14 hours. I had been driving for days and arrived at a motel in St. Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne about 6pm. I chose it because it was a straight run down to the Tasmania ferry terminal. I had a day to spare so I did not care what time I got up in the morning. The room they gave me was on the third floor and right at the back. Quiet? It might have done duty as a recording studio. So I left some luggage in the room and went out for dinner. After that I had a stroll around the area and had a couple of beers in a pub. I went back to the room and from then until maybe 8 am is a blank."
"Here are 3 actionable steps for you:

Eat at least 3 hours before going to the bed to eliminate the digestion work and improve your quality of sleep.
Get high-quality magnesium to relax your nervous system, muscles and wake up more fresh and energized in the morning.

"The cooler the room, the darker the room, the more it induces sleep. Have an ""hour to power down"". No electronics. Electronics have the blue light spectrum which tricks your brain into thinking it's the blue sky and that resets your internal clock. A soft yellow light reminds us of firelight or candlelight and makes us feel safe. When you walk into your bedroom, it should be for slept or sex only. And… a banana before bed helps. It has tryptophan along with magnesium and potassium and will help you sleep "
"No one can stick to a definite position or posture while sleeping. Actually no one is aware of how and in what position one gets good sleep.

If the ratio were to be the other way , meaning 20 good sleep and 80 bad sleep , this world would be the most treacherous and wretched planet in the Universe ! Freedom of limbs and peace of mind are most important in sleep. So wear lose clothes and listen to good music for a good sleep and happy morning. I have seen ladies sleeping in their tight clothes and men in tight jeans. For a day two it’s ok . But cannot be appreciated as a habit. Most disfigurement takes while one sleeps for hrs in tight clothes as a habit. The best age to start to sleep in lose clothes is from the nursery class!"

Write in it: bedtime, arise time, pillows tried, sleep schedule, degree of tiredness, refreshment value, window open or closed, how dark in room, indulged in a mild repast prior to retiring, etc.

You’ll soon notice useful patterns. You’ll learn if you over-imbibed alcohol prior to reclining, you’ll fall asleep fast, but likely reawaken in a few hours.

"Included factors are:

Stress free mind.
Eating habits are good enough
Well balanced diet intake
Timely sleep(if you prefer)."
I think the best is that you should have dinner as early before the bed. The people thinks that they can eat till mid night can ate any time as they want. The real fact of my life is that I ate dinner about 7 o'clock it is the perfect time and my bed time is 11 o'clock it makes be feel fresh. There is no stomach pain no head pain. So I think the there should be at least 3 hours of gap between dinner and bed time..
"Dim the lights several hours before you go to bed and turn off your screens. I prefer to read before going to sleep and that helps me dial down. I only read inspiring things before crashing out. Melatonin also works. It gives me vivid dreams, which is a cool side effect."
"Hi,, limit caffeine intake and never drink tea or coffee or chocolate at night. At least an hour or two before bed, relax with a comedy, or instrumental calming music."

"In my opinion to having a good sleep is finding a comfortable position, having clean sheets, the room isn’t too hot, not using your phone before you sleep, you can play relaxing sounds and music on your phone while you try to sleep (use the app called Calm its a good app) and don’t eat too much before you sleep."
Exercise for at least 60 minutes per day. Eat healthy and try to sleep for already 8 hours a day.

"Sometimes no matter how tired and exhausted you are, your mind just can’t seem to match your body and you end up lying away for hours. I’ve found that removing yourself from the bedroom completely and doing something like reading, light yoga, drinking some milk, or even taking a short walk can help. Just don’t touch your phone or tv remote! Research says that every minute we spend staring at a screen is another 15 minutes we’ll be awake and boy, have I learned that the hard way!

You will only wake up mad.Avoid late night snacking. I know you deserve it. Hard days suck, but try to have your triple chocolate ice cream after dinner and not right before bed. Even if you have to share with the kids… darn it! They always take it all!"
So many choices. It’s really up to what works for you. I use a sleep cycle app that helps me get better sleep and I prefer a good quality sleep mask. Darkness and no noise make a huge difference for me.
"Find out first what sleeping disorder it is first, insomnia, sleep apnea etc there is medicine for some, a CPAP machine for sleep apnea, and natural remedies for others"
"Excersize. I do not mean to go on a 5 mile run prior to hitting the sack. I am talking about a regimen in which you perform 35–45 mins of resistance excersize a days, 3 days a week.

This will make a huge difference when it’s time to get to sleep. Make sure you keep and adhere to a sleeping schedule, going to bed at or about the same times, waking earlier in the day. These things will make huge differences pertaining to you sleep patterns.

Hope this helps,

Felix"
"Sleep and get up at the same time including weekends.
I used to suffer from sleeplessness until I started sleeping on my back."
"As I have aged, getting a good night’s sleep has eluded me. Something hurts, Mother Nature calls, etc. Until I became disabled, I always got a great night’s sleep because I was able to “turn off” my day as soon as I left work. I neither thought about my day nor worried about an upcoming day, allowing me to go to sleep and stay asleep. Don’t ask me how I turned my work day off because I don’t know - I just did it."
1st and foremost1st and foremost turn off your cell phone. Then begin doing a examine of conscience prior to going to bed couple that with some prayers and finally reading especially The Bible and you will sleep soundly and heal during the night.

The yard stick for success depends upon the counting of no. of shots given by the male. A young man should be able to count and deliver 1000 shots also. So that his anxiety shall be diverted to counting work. More over, if one is likely to ejaculate @ the 30th shot, one should foresee @ the 20th shot itself. By the 15th shot he should withdraw and indulge in talks to divert and postpone ejaculation. Resume coitus after 15 minutes to recoup and proceed to increase the number slowly, but steadily. Daily one should increase the yardstick with increased no. of counted shots.  That's how every husband should target to reach and satisfy his beloved life-partner.

"Sleep has phases. REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and non-REM. You should wake up in non-REM phase. This is why sometimes you feel more tired after longer sleep than after short nap.

Do not eat an hour before sleep.

Do not look to phone before bedtime. Turn on the reading mode on your phone.

Sleep in good air conditions.

A good mattress helps.

Don't look on the clock. It makes you feel more stressed if you have to wake up in certain time.

Do some exercise activities during day such as running or playing volleyball."
"Sleep hygiene is very important for mental and physical health.

My tips:

Set a regular bedtime for yourself and try to stick to it.
Avoid screens (tv, phone, computer) for at least an hour before you go to bed - and once you are in bed. (The blue light emitted by screens reduces the amount of melatonin (the sleep hormone) your brain produces.)
Avoid anything with caffeine in the evening.
Make sure your bed and pillow are comfortable.

Good luck and sweet dreams."
Hot bath or shower right before bed and a cup of hot chamomile tea or glass of wine. If I know I’m not gonna sleep immediately I’ll read until I get tired. But my best purchase was a new mattress and sleep complete

Personally having some calming background sounds helps me fall asleep faster and sleep better. Takes the mind of to much thinking
"Regular exercise is key. It doesn't just tire you out, but it pushes the brain to produce necessary hormones to keep you sound and balanced. Too much inactivity not only increases health risks but sets your nervous system out of whack, causing less REM sleep and trouble falling asleep. Also a good diet with relatively low long - chain fats and simple sugars (bad carbs) helps. High glycemic carbohydrates store up in the body and make you more energetic. If you don't get a chance to burn you carb/fat stores you pretty much are stuck with pent up energy that never goes away. Bad diets also decreaContinue ReadingRegular exercise is key.

If you don't get a chance to burn you carb/fat stores you pretty much are stuck with pent up energy that never goes away. Bad diets also decrease interest in sexual activity, which we all know us a natural sedative. It all sounds like an elementary lesson from 5th grade biology, but these are the things that remain a constant to our physiology and sleep rhythm. Avoiding stimulants close to bed time or even altogether assist tremendously with sleep. Supplements and foods high in magnesium, medium - chain triglycerides and casein protein or amino acids like tryptophan also act as a sleep incentive. Extra supplementation of melatonin or Valerian root are good investments for children to the elderly for inducing sleep."
"One is to exercise during the day. Also, there are three methods of helping one fall asleep, to stay asleep, and to obtain sufficient deep sleep. This one is to help interrupt a constant awakening during the night: Keep a log of sleep for two weeks and calculate an average number of hours per night (we’ll use 5 to illustrate.) Choose a wake-up time (we’ll use 6 a.m.). Count backwards to establish your bedtime (in this instance 1:00 a.m.). Each morning arise at 6 a.m.—no exceptions. The idea is to compress your sleep into the designated number of hours until it becomes sound and fills the time. OContinue ReadingOne is to exercise during the day.

This one is to help interrupt a constant awakening during the night: Keep a log of sleep for two weeks and calculate an average number of hours per night (we’ll use 5 to illustrate.) Choose a wake-up time (we’ll use 6 a.m.). Count backwards to establish your bedtime (in this instance 1:00 a.m.). Each morning arise at 6 a.m.—no exceptions. The idea is to compress your sleep into the designated number of hours until it becomes sound and fills the time. Once that occurs, move bedtime back one-half hour each week until the desired number of hours is reached. This tensing, breathing exercise is to help with sleep onset delay: Lie in a quiet, comfortable place with no distractions. Tense muscles for five seconds each, beginning with the left hand, then the right, the upper left arm, then the right. Next, lift the shoulders straight up, aiming them toward the ceiling, then raise them toward the ears, then toward the floor. The head is next. Raise it straight up, then left, then right. Tense the chest, stomach, and buttocks, in that order, then the legs, first with toes pointed, then with feet flexed. This tensing should be done slowly and methodically, with deep breathing and no interruptions. Note: Yoga enthusiasts may be aware of a similar tensing exercise; for reasons not clear, this one works best for sleep. This is to help correct alpha-delta, or nonrestorative, sleep, which skips over the deepest stage of sleep: Two hours before going to sleep, recline in bath water as hot as you can tolerate. Remain thirty minutes, reheating constantly. Sound sleep depends upon a lowered body temperature. This is attained when the body intensifies its efforts to lower temperature in response to the heat."
"I don't know I the master of NOT to sleep! Never sleep well and always to little!

"1.Practice slow deep breathing when you lay down as it is one of the best ways to relax your body.

2. Avoid violent movies and/or screen time a few hours before bed.

3. Drink a calming tea without caffenine before bed."
"You should not:

..use your phone an hour before going to bed,
..drink coffee or tea, coke, energy drinks (duh)
.. have a heavy workout, sport in the hours before bedtime.
..Watch TV, or Computer. (you should just avoid any screen altogether)
.. listen to upbeat music"

This slows your heart rate and is biologically proven to put you to sleep. I think :).Try meditation. This helps me a lot. Before sleeping, try meditating in bed, and either concentrate on your breathing or try and clear your mind. There are lots of sights and even apps that can help if your a beginner.Systematic relaxation. This is where you clench, then relax each muscle in your body, starting from your feet and slowly moving up to your head. It doesn’t really work for me, but apparently it works for everybody else.Hope this helps :)"
"Go to bed regularly, preferably before midnight.

Don’t bring everyday problems with you to bed. Also don’t watch tv with Horror or other disturbing images before bedtime.

If you cannot let lose, maybe some music helps: for example „weightless“, an only Orchester piece designed for that.

Maybe before going to bed, drink a glass of warm milk with honey or nutmeg.

Or make love with your partner, until you are exhausted!"
Make a schedule based on what time you have to be somewhere in the morning. I get up at 05:00 and go to bed at 21:20 almost every night and it’s helped me get sleep by sticking to the schedule.
"Try turning off your tv and phone, so you won't be tempted to watch or use them.

Make sure the room temperature is comfortable.

Sometimes it's the bed or pillows fault. They may not be comfortable enough.

Try taking melatonin."
"I usually just think about how comfy my blanket is, if I don’t have one, I think about what I’ll do the next day"
"Some of the best ways to fall asleep are :

Have a light shower before you go to sleep.
Drink a glass of warm milk.
Listen to Weightless by Marconi Union at an ambient volume (This one’s proven to be far effective than the above mentioned…)"
From my side if you want good sleep there is just one trick run or walk in the evening and the time you feel you are really tired go back home take a bath have your dinner and sleep early ie at least at 11pm. And when you ask what tired means is that you have to exhaust your whole body not just legs till every muscle of yours is stretched and used more than everyday
I tried this technique and it is 100% working. I do Rajyoga meditation before sleep and write a letter to the GOD in which I share everything to the GOD which is running in my mind. And Follow this: “Always have the faith that whatever is happening is good and that whatever is going to happen will be even better and you will then remain unshakable and immovable.”
Eat a banana and some warm milk. Pour 1 cup milk homogenized and 1 cup water. Put nana skin in the pot and bring to a boil. This will helpź90
"Prepare a worthy bed for sleep. If you didn’t have a proper bed and pillow it may affect your sleep. Better eating habits help you get to sleep well. Always wake up with a pleasant face, not with a rough face. Morning exercise makes to feel you healthy and fresh. Your sleeping position could not be great for your body sometimes so fix your sleeping position before you get into the bed."
"Throughout my life, I never valued sleep. For as long as I can remember, school was a blur of homework, classes, and extracurriculars broken up by 4-hour “power naps” at night. When I started working, things didn’t get much better. Client calls from different timezones, company meetings, project deliverables, happy hours, weekend outings… Throughout all of this, sleep just wasn’t on the agenda. After Continue ReadingThroughout my life, I never valued sleep. For as long as I can remember, school was a blur of homework, classes, and extracurriculars broken up by 4-hour “power naps” at night. When I started working, things didn’t get much better. Client calls from different timezones, company meetings, project deliverables, happy hours, weekend outings… Throughout all of this, sleep just wasn’t on the agenda. After reading Arianna Huffington’s book Thrive [ https://amzn.to/2GGuR17 ], I decided right then and there that I needed to change. A stroke or heart attack at 40 isn’t for me. Here are the steps I took to improve my sleep patterns: Wake up at the same time every day (6am) No matter what you do, be sure to wake up at the same time every day. Your schedule probably won’t be the same as mine, but for me, this is 6am when my partner needs to get up and ready for work. Waking up at the same time every day has my mind and body set on a routine. It helps center me and builds the can-do attitude to handle all the demands of the day. Sleep by 11pm I can’t emphasize this enough. We as humans are habitual creatures that evolved to live and breathe according to natural circadian rhythms. Around this clock time (I say “clock time” since this happens without the clock, too), our body naturally releases chemicals that are designed to repair the body. And it does this best while you sleep. To wake up feeling refreshed the next day, be sure to get to bed by 11pm. Cut out alcohol Sure you can absolutely crash out after a night of hard drinking, but that sleep is never good sound sleep. Your body is in absolute turmoil after a night of drinking and the havoc inside filtering alcoholic toxins from your body takes away from the wear and tear repair your body normally does. If you can, skip the drinking for a good night’s rest. Exercise every day Although I switch it up all the time, I make sure to get some sort of exercise every day. Mondays are for running, Tuesdays for Soccer, Wednesdsays are for yoga, Thursdays are ..."
"Check your temperature (many studies show 68 degrees F is optimal,… but you might like it cooler or warmer depending on how much covers you like).

Also, invest in a good mattress and cotton or linen sheets that breathe.

Also pay attention to level of darkness, sound, and smells… pick with what works best for you."
"Get a routine.

Go to sleep and wake up everyday at the same time.

Turnoff computers, phones, tvs , 2 hours before bedtime.

Eat a light snack

Milk, a half of turkey sandwich or what you like.

Nothing heavy like fried foods, spicy foods etc.

Maybe take a shower

Get ready for tomorrow

Take a book to bed, easy reading, no technical reading.

If reading doesn't work, not being funny or pervy, have sex or masturbate."

You’re going to have a hard time napping if there are lots of loud and abrupt noises occurring in the background, which is easily solvable with a regular pair of earplugs. You could even grab a pair of headphones to listen to some soothing ambient music, nature sounds or white noise at a moderately set volume. 2. Shut the blinds or use an eye mask to darken your environment. Melatonin, the hormone that promotes sleep, is stimulated by a dark environment. If you can’t control the amount of light coming into the room by closing the curtains or shutting the blinds, place something like an eye mask, a scarf or some other piece of fabric over your eyes to keep it dark. 3. Throw on a sweater or use a blanket to keep yourself warm. Your body temperature naturally starts to decrease as you drift to sleep. To avoid being woken up by the discomfort of feeling too cold, cover up with a sweater or a blanket before you settle down for your nap. 4. Have a quick cup of coffee immediately before you take a nap. Everyone knows that caffeine wakes people up, but if you can manage to play with the timing of your caffeine consumption by avoiding it in the hours before your nap and then letting yourself have a cup right before, then you’ll be setting yourself up for a good day. It takes about 20 minutes for the caffeine to hit your brain, which is why this type of “coffee nap” is really one of the most effective ways to feel refreshed after 20 minutes of rest. 5. Avoid eating foods high in sugar and caffeine an hour or two before your nap. A sugar high and the jitters won’t help you relax at all. Limit coffee to the morning, and avoid those delicious donuts and pastries throughout the late morning or afternoon if you plan on taking a quality nap at some point. 6. Eat foods that are rich in calcium or protein an hour or two before your nap. Certain foods will help you nap better than others. Anything high in calcium or protein will do the trick, so consider adding some yogurt, almonds, oatmeal and other healthy choices to your lunch. 7. Aim to nap after lunch. There’s a convenient dip in energy that occurs for most people right after lunch that’s ideal for napping—even if you don’t have a typical schedule or didn’t eat lunch. Eating lunch, however, will most certainly make it easier to nap. 8. Don’t lie down in a horizontal position if you plan to avoid slipping into a deep sleep. You’re more likely to fall into a deep sleep if you nap while lying straight down. If you do plan to nap on a bed or a couch, make sure your head is propped up against the wall, headboard or edge of the couch with a pillow or something soft. 9. Set your alarm according to what you want to get out of your nap. The amount of time you should set for your nap depends on what your goal is. If you’re feeling drowsy and all you want to do is snap out of it, a quick 2- to 5-minute nap might be all you need. For a bigger boost in alertness, focus, stamina and energy, you’ll need at least 5 to 20 minutes. The typical power nap is about 20 minutes long, which offers the additional benefits of improving your memory and clearing your mind. 10. Don’t even think about taking a nap without setting an alarm. This really is the golden rule of napping, and it’s the one essential thing you need to do to avoid losing hours of your day to an extended state of unconsciousness. It only takes a few seconds to set an alarm on your laptop or phone to make sure you get up when you should. 11. Avoid sleeping with an empty stomach. Make sure to eat during the day to avoid hunger pains during sleep. If you are trying to lose weight eat small meals throughout the day to allow your body to obtain energy from fats at night. Avoid heavy meals within two hours of bedtime. Stick with small healthy meals a couple of hours before bed to receive a better night’s sleep."
"Growing up I was a nocturnal being and would consistently go to sleep at 2:00am only to wake up four to five hours later and get on with my day. The thing is, unless you pay close attention over a long period of time you never notice the effect that sleep deprivation has on your health and performance in your life. Your body does an amazing job of hiding the fact that you’re sleep-deprived and this can have a very harmful effect on your mental health as well. Over the years I’ve accounted myself 30% less productive when I don’t sleep on time or when I get hooked on to my phone or other distractContinue ReadingGrowing up I was a nocturnal being and would consistently go to sleep at 2:00am only to wake up four to five hours later and get on with my day. The thing is, unless you pay close attention over a long period of time you never notice the effect that sleep deprivation has on your health and performance in your life. Your body does an amazing job of hiding the fact that you’re sleep-deprived and this can have a very harmful effect on your mental health as well. Over the years I’ve accounted myself 30% less productive when I don’t sleep on time or when I get hooked on to my phone or other distractions, and that the work I produce is of a lower quality (and has more mistakes). Considering the effect it has on our ability to reason, focus, think, and function in general, there are few things as important as getting a good night’s rest. Here are some quick hacks to sleep better:Stick to a Schedule: Keep your sleep/wake cycle ( or pattern) on track by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day - even on weekends. If you must sleep in on Saturday or Sunday, try not to stay in bed for more than an extra hour or two, max.Pay Attention to what you drink and eat: I was addicted to coffee and as we know that caffeine is a stimulant, but I used to drink coffee after my dinner, which used to make me very stimulant at the wrong time. Dont drink any stimulant at least four hours before bed, ideally after mid-day. Alcohol can wake you up in the middle of the night and should be avoided in the two to three hours before bedtime. Be mindful not to go to bed too stuffed else that can interfere your sleep as well.Relax during your bedtime: Relaxation is vital in order to fall asleep faster, so try doing something regularly in the hour before bed that your brain will associate with sleep, such as listening to calm noises, practicing a few simple yoga poses or taking a warm bath.Step Away From the bright light: Your body clock is affected by light, so turn off bright overhead lights, lamps, and all screens at least an hour before bed, since they will only rev you up. If it's too hard to turn off lights or screens completely, at least dim them to prep your body for sleep.Make Your Bedroom very comfy: Use this room for only sleep and relaxation, so that you don’t associate it with other distractions, such as working on your laptop or worrying about an upcoming payment. Keep these distractions outside your room while only good vibes inside the room.These hacks are very difficult to drift away your routine but, like I always relate every answer of mine to my life, it has actually changed my life. It will do good to you as well. Don’t give up easily because it takes 1 day to break a good habit but at least 21 days to break a bad habit and form a good one. Cheers :)"

If possible, wake up at the same time each day.
Go to bed around the same time every day, but not more than 8 hours before you expect to start your day.
Avoid beverages with caffeine or alcohol in the evening.

"It depends on what you want to change. The first important point is to use your bedroom only for sleep (and relations with one your love).

You can find more hints by looking up “sleep hygiene.” It you wake up too much too early, you should talk with your doctor. At one point, while driving, I fell asleep at a stop sign. After six years of insomnia sleeping 3–4 hours a night, I finally talked with a doctor. There are many reasons for insomnia; mine was early morning awaking brought on by anxiety and depression. Several decades later, I was always exhausted. While traveling with with a friend and again with my sister, I was told I snored and made loud noises. That exhaustion was due to sleep apnea. i have struggled with sleep, so my first recommendation is that if sleep difficulties are creating problems in your life, talk with a doctor, perhaps a sleep doctor. I hope you will find the solution. You may be able to solve your problem by yourself (look up sleep hygiene), if not, seek help. I wasted far too many years being exhausted when I could have had a better life."
"Keep the room cool. Too hot means you won't get comfortable. Keep the room dark. As dark as you reasonably can. No screens within 30 min of trying to sleep. No TV, phone, etc. Don't workout too close to bedtime. Again, 30 min buffer. Don't do anything in bed except sleep and sex. Keep a pad and pen by your bed. If you're someone who has a racing mind when you're trying to sleep, it helps to write down your thoughts, get them out of your head and leave them on the pad.

Use a sound machine or app if you have trouble with outside noise. My husband likes to watch TV in the next room when I'm sleeping, so I turn on a white noise machine and it keeps me from hearing his shows. Don't cheap out on your mattress (unless you LOVE your cheap mattress). Find one that works well for you. A good mattress is important. If you must take something to sleep, start with something low-key, like melatonin. Don't go straight for the sleeping pills. You could end up not being able to sleep without them eventually. Get comfortable, close your eyes, and breathe deeply through your nose. To relax your whole body, it can help to purposefully tense your muscles one by one (legs, then arms, etc), hold them tense for a few seconds, and then release. You can feel the tension flowing out. Good luck!"
You should not use your mobile while you are going to bed and you should try to make your sleeping schedual same. These two things helped me alot
"Taking excersise is da best way to get sleep very easily, cz excersise releases endorphins n mny other chemicals from brain tht make sleep very easy n besides this medication helps alot."
What worked for me is 1–2 hours of exercise few hours before going to bed. It helped me get up much easier compared to when you don’t do any physical exercise at all in a day. I usually do it after work.

If you have to sleep in the afternoon, just take 40 winks, nothing longer.Avoid horror movies or anything gory that you may keep rewinding in your head once you switch off the TV and get into bed. It’s not only such movies; any kind of programme you may have watched just before sleep. Stop! don’t think about the scenes as soon as your head touches the pillow. Once you start, it will go on and on. Even if you have to think about something personal and urgent for the next day, do it quickly and switch off your mind. You’ll get sleep.Make sure your bed is comfortable, your pillow is just right and you have the perfect lighting in the room. Dim lighting is always preferred to total darkness for most individuals. Keep the room pleasant and happy.Make a sleep routine for yourself. Chart out a specific time for night sleep and try to maintain it. It’s most likely you’ll find it difficult to fall asleep if you go to bed later than the allotted time.Have a good wholesome, but preferably light dinner. Don’t eat any junk food before bed as it could make you feel overstuffed and interfere with your sleep. Try and avoid any kind of caffeine.Medication could also cause sleepless nights. So, tell your doctor your problem and ask for the right time to take particular medicines. He will know how to help you in this.Keep yourself active throughout the day to enhance tiredness by the end of the day so that you get good quality sleep at night.Last, but not the least, stop stressing over this problem. It’s really not such a big deal. If you get down to following some of the steps mentioned above, I’m quite sure it will help you to some extent. Try it. I have personally experienced some of the above and felt I could be quite helpful in this area."

Breathe deeply and slowly throughout the day. Hold your breath for a few second after every deep breath. Drink six litres of water every day. Eat small meals when hungry just to satisfy your hunger. Do not eat any carbohydrates if you are above 30 years of age. Have an early dinner or better still stop eating after afternoon tea. Go to bed early after reading a novel. Wake up early. Do not drink alcohol and soda ever.

If you can identify what’s keeping you awake at nigh, or whenever you sleep, you may find your answer."

Make sure the curtains sufficiently block the light. Don’t keep devices on that make any sound. Your daytime routine does affect the way you sleep, so try to take a few things in consideration. Make sure you’ve eaten something a few hours before you sleep, you can’t sleep on an empty stomach. However don’t eat just before going to bed, make sure there’s some time in between so your digestion can start up while you’re still awake. Also don’t drink anything that’ll keep you awake before going to bed, like coffee or coke. Then when you get into bed, try not to think of anything. Sure you got your worries, but they can wait until tomorrow. Just don’t think about them. Make your head empty and relax."

"To get a better night’s sleep there a several things that you can do. Starting from the time you are getting ready for bed to when you get up in the morning, your approach to sleep can really help to give you a better nights rest. 1. Set up a night-time routine One of the most important things in getting a better nights sleep is to have a nighttime routine in place.

Starting from the time you are getting ready for bed to when you get up in the morning, your approach to sleep can really help to give you a better nights rest. 1. Set up a night-time routine One of the most important things in getting a better nights sleep is to have a nighttime routine in place. If you follow the same routine each night, your body will eventually learn to wind down when you start getting ready for bed. Put things in your night time routine that help to relax you physically and mentally. Things like meditation, gentle yoga for sleep, writing in a journal etc. Anything that helps process your day and allow you to wind down and switch off for the night. 2. Set up a morning routine Seems slightly strange to think about the morning for a good nights sleep but setting up a morning routine alongside your night-time one can help to get your circadian rhythm back on track. Quite often when we are struggling to sleep, our sleep and wake up times are all over the place. Setting yourself a time to wake up every day and a time to go to sleep every day, can help to force your sleep pattern back to a time that works for you. 3. Limit sleep during the day Whilst it’s very tempting to sleep all day when you have had no sleep, you are just going reinforcing the pattern of daytime sleeping and nighttime waking. If you need to sleep to continue functioning, try to limit yourself to an hours nap at the most. Initially changing your sleep habits can be difficult, but don’t give up! 4. Move things slowly if it gets too much If changing your routine completely becomes overwhelming or leaves you completely unable to sleep, change things one step at a time. If you don’t fall asleep till early morning, try to bring that forward by 1 hour. If you sleep in late in the morning, try to wake up 1 hour earlier. If that is still too much, try half an hour. This is not a race. Change things at a rate that you can actually sustain. It’s better to take several months to get to where you want to be, rather than never getting there at all. 5. Work on reducing stress One of the biggest reasons for not sleeping is because we are stressed and anxious and worrying the whole night long. Look at techniques like meditation and mindfulness, writing in a journal, using to-do lists and SMART goals etc. If you are really struggling with overthinking or stress during the night, it might even be worth considering seeing a therapist to help give you the techniques to help you work on any anxiety or depression that might be causing your sleep issues. 6. Aim for relaxation, not sleep The biggest lesson that I have learned in improving my sleep habits is to aim for relaxation. When you lie down and pressure yourself to sleep, you are just going to spend the whole night getting more and more stressed the longer you are awake and watching the clock tick down until morning. If you aim for relaxation, you know that at least you will be somewhat refreshed in the morning and you are far more likely to accidentally fall asleep than if you are sitting thinking about not sleeping. Changing your sleep habits is not an easy thing to do, but with some simple life changes and a lot of patience and perseverance it is possible to get a better night’s sleep."

Insomnia is real, I suffer on and off with it myself. So that could also be a contributing factor. Additionally, the two types of sleep apnea can and most likely will disturb consistent sleep patterns, as it results in lack of oxygen to the brain. If this occurs you could sleep for 12 hours and never wake up feeling fully rested. Perhaps for some people watching movies or digesting content that is disturbing or causes excessive thoughts right before sleep is probably best to avoid. For example if you’re afraid of the dark watching a movie that deals with that type of thrill is probably not the best idea right before you put yourself in a dark and quiet room. Especially if you have a healthy imagination. I’m not just talking about children here. For some weed or drops in that realm helps with sleep. Results vary on that one. Can also have the opposite effect. And you’ll want it to be legal in your state or country. Lastly, your body produces what’s called Melatonin, or theoretically is supposed to. Sometimes we under produce it and some don’t produce much of it at all. You can get it over the counter. It is natural, not a drug. But do familiarize yourself with it especially if you’re giving it to children. We don’t need the young ones sleeping for days straight. If you go this route (and it can work) its advised to take in 1–2 hours before sleep and before 12am, or it could leave you feeling unrested when you wake up."

In actual sense healthy sleeping means- giving our body a proper rest which it requires. Each individual has diffrent body requirements so it is obviously seen that the requirement of rest will also varry person to person.In this blog we will discuss about healthy sleeping and its basic which will help us for applying it in our lives. Good sleep is a topic that is often neglected, but it is a very important aspect of our everyday life. Sleep has been extensively studied and affects our quality of life in many ways — be it our efficiency at work, our endurance when it comes to daily tasks, or the prevention of diseases and maintenance of mental health, just to name a few. What is healthy sleeping? In basic healthy sleeping means giving body a proper amount of rest which it requires. Tips for helthy sleeping: 1. Sleep in well-ventilated rooms and air out your home frequently During respiration, we take up oxygen from the air and release carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Sleeping in closed, small rooms or confined spaces leads to CO 2 buildup. When the concentration of CO 2 reaches the limit of 1'000 ppm, a number of body functions such as thinking, coordination, and sleep become affected. There are many devices on the market that monitor indoor air quality. These can be used to measure the amount of CO 2 in bedrooms, offices, cars, and public spaces (e.g., restaurants). A CO 2 level of over 2'000 ppm can lead to headaches, poor concentration, increased heart rate, and nausea. A level above 40'000 ppm can cause brain damage, comas, and even death (values established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health). 2 . Pay attention to room temperature, air humidity, and pollution The conditions for good sleep are met when the body doesn’t have to regulate its own temperature, reaching what is called the “thermoneutrality state.” You can achieve this without wearing pajamas at an environmental temperature of 86–90 o F (30–32 o C) or wearing pajamas and covering yourself with at least one sheet at 61–66 o F (16–19 o C). 2 Warm blankets may hinder your sleep during the summer, and having cold feet in the winter also makes falling asleep more difficult. Sleeping in a warm and highly humid environment increases the frequency of wakefulness episodes while low humidity dries out and inflames the respiratory tract.Ideally, humidity in the bedroom should be between 40–60 %. To increase humidity, you can use a vaporizer or a humidifier, or simply place bowls of water near the heat sources. The common methods to decrease humidity include promoting air flow (ventilating) and using a dehumidifier or an air conditioner. Air pollution (mostly associated with traffic) affects sleep by acting upon the central nervous system and the upper airways. This can lead to reduced oxygen levels in the blood, respiratory acidosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. Furthermore, air pollutants can also contain allergens that induce inflammation, which in turn affects sleep quality. Air pollution meters usually display the VOC value (volatile organic compounds).3. Turn off all sources of light Sleep is governed by light. Our internal clock (a group of cells in the hypothalamus) receives the signals that the eye sends in the presence of darkness or light. In response, it then generates either a state of sleepiness (by increasing the production of melatonin) or alertness (by increasing body temperature and releasing various hormones). During the night, when the eye detects the slightest source of light (e.g., TV or electric clocks) the production of melatonin is stopped and sleep is affected. Sleeping with a night-light, staying up late in front of the TV or computer screen, and using your phone have all been shown to interfere with sleep. 4. Include sports in your daily activity If exercising right before bed prevents some people from falling asleep because of overstimulation, exercising in the morning or throughout the day definitely increases both the quality and duration of sleep. A study conducted in 2014 showed that eight weeks of aerobic exercise can significantly increase sleep quality in middle-aged women while other studies have shown significant improvement in sleep quality in both men and women when a form of physical activity was performed regularly. 5.Set up a healthy bedtime routine Establish a bedtime routine (e.g., reading, walks in nature, and/or meditation) and try to have consistent sleep-wake times (go to bed and wake up every day at the same time). These habits have been shown to improve sleep quality and reduce the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep. Significant improvements have been observed in children, but studies show similar effects in adults and the elderly Most of the time, people are not aware of their habits and the activities they engage in during the hour before they go to sleep. Nevertheless, these have a significant impact on the quality of their nighttime rest. For example, using smartphones in bed and being exposed to blue light has been associated with longer sleep latency, sleep disturbances, and decreased performance the next day. The duration of sleep varies strongly based on individual characteristics and age. Significant changes in sleep duration and deviations from the norm are usually associated with tobacco exposure, hypercholesterolemia, screen time, and body weight . Obese children typically experience shorter sleep duration and variable sleep patterns, while TV viewing and the presence of a TV in the bedroom is also associated with shorter sleep duration. So here are all the common factors which we can apply in our life for healthy sleeping.Importance of healthy sleeping: 1. Better productivity and concentration There were several studies that scientists did in the early 2000s that looked at the effects of sleep deprivation. What the researchers concluded is that sleep has links to several brain functions, including:concentrationproductivitycognitionA more recent 2015 study in the journal of child phsycology and psychiatry showed that children’s sleep patterns can have a direct impact on their behavior and academic performance. 2 . Lower weight gain risk There have been several studies throughout the years that have linked obesity and poor sleep patterns. However, a more recent study in the journal sleep medicine concludes that there is no link between being overweight and sleep deprivation. This research argues that many previous studies fail to account adequately for other factors, such as:drinking alcoholliving with type 2 diabatieslevel of physical activityeducation levelslong working hourslong sedentary timeA lack of sleep may affect a person’s desire or ability to maintain a healthful lifestyle, but it may or may not be a direct contributor to weight gain. link between weight gain and obesity and short sleep patterns is not completely clear. 3. Greater athletic performance According to the national sleep foundation, adequate sleep for adults is between 7 and 9 hours a night, and athletes may benefit from as many as 10 hours. Accordingly, sleep is as important to athletes as consuming enough calories and nutrients. One of the reasons for this requirement is that the body heals during sleep. Other benefits include:better performance intensitymore energybetter coordinationfaster speedbetter mental functioning4. Lower risk of heart disease One risk factor for heart disease is high blood pressure . According to the centres for disease and prevention (CDC) , getting adequate rest each night allows the body’s blood pressure to regulate itself. Doing so can reduce the chances of sleep-related conditions such as apnea and promote better overall heart health. 5. Stronger immune system Sleep helps the body repair, regenerate, and recover. The immune system is no exception to this relationship. Some research shows how better sleep quality can help the body fight off infection. However, scientists still need to do further research into the exact mechanisms of sleep in regards to its impact on the body’s immune system. So, these are few methods and importance of healthy sleeping. These methods were acknowledge in a sense of making it applicable to every indivudual.

"Ensure that you have proper sleep hygiene. This means that your bedroom should not be used as an office or a tv room. There is only one thing for what you should use your bedroom for, and that is sleep . You should not be on your laptop or ipad in bed. In addition to keeping your bedroom for only sleep, you should keep your bedroom cool. Research points to room temperature playing a part in SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).

An alarm can add to your stress levels by getting your adrenaline rushing using light instead can cause us to feel more alert, can enhance mood and lead to better memory and concentration throughout the day  5) Disconnect yourself from devices like your phones and laptops too much artificial light can reduce the production of melatonin in the brain, making it harder for you to fall asleep. Try to disconnect for 30 minutes or more before going to bed.  6) Follow these strategies -Before going to bed listening to relaxing music, reading a book, taking a hot bath, meditating, deep breathing, and visualization can improve your sleep quality.  6) Don’t consume caffeine late in the day  7) Optimize your bedroom environment  8) Don’t eat late in the evening -Try 4 hours before bed,it helped people fall asleep faster.  Thankyou :)"

First of all, you need to do various physical activities during the day as it improves the sleep. For example, go to gym or do yoga.
It is important to keep yourself busy throughout the day, so at night you will be tired enough to go to sleep.
And lastly, you need to sleep on time, when you feel a little bit sleepy, you should not ignore it and go sleep."

"Some effective way to sleep:

Don't eat just before sleep. There should be 3 to 4 hours gap between dinner and sleeping time.
Never take heavy diet in night.
Do some deep breathing exercise for 5 to 10 minutes before sleep.
Never watch any negative stuff before sleep
Do daily exercise, yoga and meditation."
"The logic for effective sleep is to slow down thought process of mind or decrease frequency of thoughts emerging from mind. There are number of ways to achieve this like reading a book, avoiding watching TV or mobile, sitting in silence before sleep time, listening to light & soothing music to calm down mind. Try to fix sleep time everyday for better results. I think above tips would help you in achieving effective sleep."
"I can only speak from my own experiences. The worst trouble I ever had with sleep was when I let my schedule roll into different hours. I either stayed up late, slept in, or napped too long. It took weeks sometimes to feel like I was sleeping good again. Another thing that causes sleep problems still, is drinking too much before bed. I get up several times at night if I do, and feel tired throughout the next day. I have issues with comfort if there is sand or crumbs in the bed, and noise can keep me awake, so I use a fan for white noise."
"You could try reading a book until you doze off. Another thing that you can do is to lay on your bed and stay in the dark for a few hours without seeing any visible light at all, especially the light that is emmited from computer screens and phones, cause the blue radiation is said to wake up the brain. A doctor had suggested this strategy to me and sometimes it has helped me sleep. If those do not work, then you can drink a glass of whiskey. But do this in moderation, too much alcohol is not a good thing. Hope this helps."

reduce social media usage
Dinner should good 3–4 hours before sleep time.

If you’re struggling with pain or other health issues, you might need to switch your sleep position in order to help manage it. And, while it might not be something you can do in one night, it can definitely be worth trying out. Taking the time to gradually train yourself to sleep in a new position could be the secret to improving your sleep quality. However, if that’s something you aren’t comfortable with, don’t stress about it. You can also try modifying your favorite sleep position to make sure you’re getting the most out of it. Every individual is different. What’s important is that you’re doing what works for your body and your sleep needs Fetal positionThere’s a reason why this is the most popular sleep position. The fetal position has loads of benefits. Not only is it great for lower back pain or pregnancy, sleeping in the fetal position can help reduce snoring. Unfortunately, sleeping in the fetal position does have a few downsides. Make sure your posture is relatively loose, otherwise your comfy position could limit deep breathing while you snooze. Also, if you have any issues with joint pain or stiffness, sleeping in a tight fetal position might leave you sore in the morning. Sleeping on your sideAs it turns out, sleeping on your sideis actually pretty good for you — especially if you’re sleeping on your left side. Not only can it help reduce snouring, it’s great for your digestion and might even reduce heartburn. An older study looked at 10 people over the course of two days. The first day, participants rested on their right side after eating a high-fat meal. On the second, they switched to the left side. While this was a small study, researchers discovered that sleeping on the right side increased heartburn and acid reflux, which suggests it could be a good reason for switching sides at night. Sleeping on your side, on the other hand, may not always be the best. Not only can it cause stiffness in your shoulders, it can also lead to jaw tigtness on that side. Plus, research suggests that sleeping on your side could contribute to wrinkles. Putting a pillow between your lower legs will help better align your hips to avoid low back pain. SLEEPING TIP If you prefer sleeping on your side, make sure to sleeping on a pillow to avoid neck and back pain. Sleep on whichever side feels most comfortable, but don’t be afraid to switch to a different position if it’s not working for you.SLEEPING TIP If sleeping on your back, try sleeping with a pillow behind your knees to reduce back pain and relieve pressure on your spine. If you’re congested, you can also prop yourself up with an extra pillow to make breathing easier."

"I personally follow this routine before I go to bed.

No use of electronic gadgets like mobile or laptop one hour prior to bed.
Meditate or I chant my Ho’oponopono prayer on my beads (approx 145 min)
Introspect on what was the learning for the day and journal the same
End day with my night gratitude list
Put on my affirmation audio

It's a matter of 5–7 min and I am in my sound sleep.

"physically referred, our spine shouldn’t be in up position between 1 am and 3 am.

So an ideal time for sleep is between 10 pm and 4 am, out of which 1 to 3 takes us to deep sleep (when almost all evil practices in the world esp. theft takes place). The above recommended sleeping pattern of 10–4 need not be the same for everybody. Because of various commitments of modern age and our needy (sometimes greedy) situational pressures we are pushed away to irregular practices. Don’t worry. Most important is getting some rest (along with work) and sleep is ultimate means of rest (others being sitting back, having a chat, watching TV, having a refreshment, etc). Eye is the predominant part that commands the brain to prepare for sleep. So relieving the eye from works of strain and stress is the first step. For some it may be smart phone, for others TV, computer, or even cooking, reading, stitching, whatever be. Even a heavy food may be one such one. So plan your night(also your night food). Write it down. start with when to wake up because then only you can decide when to lie down (not sleep, sleep is an aftermath of lying). note, wake has an ‘up’ in itself, and lie a ‘down’. YES, when you wake up try to see the ‘up’ things like sky, trees, mountains, flying birds, etc. Likewise, when you decide (yes, DECISION is important- a quality only human beings have got - without which our life will be just like any animal) when you decide to go to lie down try to look ‘down’ on things that are insignificant, like how an ant is moving in row(not in the web; practical), how the soap water foams bubbles, or how the candle melts in itself, etc. I bet, you will be snoring in the next 30 minutes. If you have a master at home to scrutiny this, better. if not, a heavy fasting with light fruits intake will be your master. To teach us something NEW, a MENTOR is a must. Good luck!"
"Before going to sleep just make sure you won't be seeing any electronic gadgets like mobile, laptop, tv etc atleast for 1 hour.

Start reading a book.

Have some luke warm milk before going to sleep.

This will definitely help.

Been their done that"

Interesting enough to keep you listening, but not like a movie or TV show where you have to stay awake to see the end. SPeaking of movies however, I often turn on one of my favorite movies, screen off, just audio, and listen to it while I fall asleep. It keeps my mind off daily worries, and I have seen/heard the movie so many times that I do not need to stay awake to see how it ends. Often I have seen it enough that I can actually “watch” it in my head and see the scene that goes along with it."

"Ten tips for better sleep: 1.Warm milk. You can put a delicious spin on your grandmother’s usual sleeplessness remedy by drinking warm milk previous to bed. Almond milk is an outstanding resource of calcium, which helps the brain to create the melatonin. Plus, it may flash the pleasing and calming memory of your mother helping you fall asleep. 2.Manage the stress. When you’re wiped out during the day from the work routine, you tend to feel even more stressed, and petulant. Which is why taking the steps to handle your stress is so significant to attain restful sleep. So you should begin sitting crossContinue ReadingTen tips for better sleep: 1.Warm milk. You can put a delicious spin on your grandmother’s usual sleeplessness remedy by drinking warm milk previous to bed. Almond milk is an outstanding resource of calcium, which helps the brain to create the melatonin. Plus, it may flash the pleasing and calming memory of your mother helping you fall asleep. 2.Manage the stress. When you’re wiped out during the day from the work routine, you tend to feel even more stressed, and petulant. Which is why taking the steps to handle your stress is so significant to attain restful sleep. So you should begin sitting cross-legged and do the meditation before the sleep. 3.Develop a sleep routine. It might seem tempting, but sleeping until noon on Saturday will only disrupt your biological clock and cause more sleep problems. Going to bed at the same time every night, even on weekends, holidays, and other days off helps to establish your interna sleep/wake clock and reduces the amount of tossing and turning required to fall asleep. 4.Change your diet. Cut out the food and drinks that contain caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and chocolate, by mid-afternoon. Make dinner your lightest meal, and finish it a few hours before bedtime. Skip spicy or heavy foods, which can keep you awake with heartburn or indigestion. 5.Don’t smoke. A study found that smokers are four times more likely to not feel as well rested after a full night’s sleep than nonsmokers. School of Medicine attributes this to the stimulative effect of nicotine and the nighttime withdrawal from it. Smoking also exacerbates sleep apnea and other breathing disorders such as asthma, which can make it difficult to get restful sleep. 6.Making time for the workout. In case, you missed the memorandum, being bodily active is necessary for sleeping well. The mounting proof shows that people who exercise frequently tend to sleep better than their couch potato counterparts, particularly when it comes to those with constant insomnia. 7.Keep cool. “The ideal temperature for your thermostat is between 65 and 72 degrees”,. Women who are going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes should keep the room as cool as possible and wear cotton or breathable fabric to bed. 8.Go dark. A National Sleep Foundation (NSF) survey found that nearly all participants used some type of electronics, like a television, computer, video game, or cell phone, within the last hour before going to bed. That’s a bad idea. Light from these devices stimulates the brain, making it harder to wing down. Put your gadgets away an hour before bedtime to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more soundly 9.Black it out. Light tells your brain that it’s time to wake up, so make your room as dark as possible for sleep. Even a small amount of ambient light from your cell phone or computer can disrupt the production of melatonin (a hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles) and overall sleep. 10.Use your bed for sleeping only. Your bed should be associated with sleeping, not working, eating, or watching TV. If you wake up during the night skip turning on your laptop or TV and do something soothing like meditation or reading until you feel sleepy again. Sleep is a beautiful thing. If you feel you’re not getting enough sleep, or not enjoying quality sleep, these simple adjustments can help contribute to a more restful night"

"Q: What do you do to get a good night’s sleep? Wake up early, say 5am, and go exercise. Not just a walk but make a real effort with a coach or trainer. Something like a boot camp, a master’s swim team, a spin class, or some other hour-long fitness class. Then go to work all day. Then, after work, go to the gym for 20–30 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of weight training. Do that for a few days and you should sleep pretty well. If you still have trouble, then also go for a brisk walk during your lunch break.

"I sleep throughout the day because I feel depressed and nihilistic, I’m trying to avoid contact with people because I’m irritable and I don’t want to hear anyone talking to me, having to listen exhausts me. I take SSRI, that makes me feel drowsy and doesn’t help for my depression, I use that time window when I’m drowsy to put myself back to sleep.

It’s annoying and barely takes the edge off the depressed state that I’m in almost constantly. Doesn’t even come close to efficiency of amphetamines, which in the matter of seconds eliminate depression entirely."
"There are many aspects.

One I particularly like to mention, is wearing eye-mask. It helps to ensure pitch dark when you sleep. It’s very hard to make pitch dark room, but it’s easy to wear an eye-mask to give it the same effect.

You might think the difference is negligible (pitch dark vs. normal dark), but it has a significant difference to your sleep."

put the blanket over your body and then you can start listening to music , or you can think about something that you like

sometimes , you can let the window open to feel the wind blowing slowly on your chin and then you can close your eyes slowly , falling asleep in the beautiful silence."
Drinking Chamomile or Blackcurrant tea helps me ease the sleeping process. Deep breathing for approx. 5–10mins relaxes muscles and stress levels when thinking doesn’t let me sleep. Another method that aids sleeping for me is applying petroleum jelly vaseline on my eyelids and eye lashes. This not relaxes the eyes but also helps eye lashes grow😇

"Think less one think help

Aviod tea or coffe after 4 pm

Do some excesses which make body to get tied take hot water bath

Use curd or buttermilk which help to good sleep"
"You can sleep well by removing all the thoughts from your mind and the best way to do so is meditation. Just do meditation when you don’t feel sleepy at night.

Many times, we don’t feel sleepy as there’s something which lacks like if you haven’t done some important work or you haven’t eaten according to your hunger. And sometimes, we don’t feel sleepy because our sleep has been completed already.

So be calm and relax, listen music, and just chill. You will definitely get slept.

"Eating early dinner and keeping your stomach empty/ feel light before you sleep

You should sleep and wake up at the same time. Example 10:00 pm to 6:00 am is your sleeping time, then follow this routine so that your biological clock will get tuned that way.

Taking warm bath at night (before your dinner) or well after dinner(2hrs) before you go to bed

Reading books before you go to sleep.

Avoiding Tv,Mobile usage 2 hrs before you sleep.

Stress free mindset.

All these can help us to sleep better at night in my experience"

"Whatever work you do, all you need is to rest your body and mind to kick start your next day with full energy.

Every time I had this issue of overthinking or gluing onto the phone doing nothing rather than wasting my energy.

Then once I found a way to come out of those traumas that helps me perform better the following day.

The key to sleep is to tired your mind. Start doing activities that make your brain tired.

Hear out from Gigi Buffon where he follows every time during sleep,"
"The method that I find useful and I learnd it from the book Atomic Habits is that assign places for your work. Like if you are on your study chair, do only studies on it.

Some of us have TV in our bedroom so we get into our bed and keep watching till late night. This way your mind is not able to assign a habit with a particular place. Your mind percieve as if your bed is the place where you watch TV or youtube on your mobile or play video games and not the place you should be falling asleep. So try to train your mind that your bed is the place where you should fall asleep. Try not to watch TV or check out social media on your mobile when you are about to sleep. If you need to check your mobile for work related stuff, get out of bed and stand while you check your notifications or get out of your bedroom. Move the TV out of your bedroom. Over the time mind gets subconsciously trained to realte habits with a particular place. I hope this method helps you."
Go to bed when your tired you will sleep better. Drink a cup of chamomile tea before bed. Or some oat meal. Try to go to sleep at the same time each day and your body clock will kick in. You will fall asleep quickly.
"To get good sleep don't think about negative things

Think about positive things you have done in past

Listen music or read books before you sleep

Then think about positive things and pray to god

And then go to the bed your mind will be full of

Positivity and you will get good sleep.

"#1 Try a weighted blanket. It won’t put you to sleep, but you’ll sleep sounder, as it’s similar to swaddling.

Just get up, do something else for a while, and then try again. Worry naturally inhibits sleep, and if you’re worried about something, doing something else will offset it, especially if you can accomplish a goal by doing it. #6 Exercise, but not right before bed. Exercise throughout the day will leave your body ready to sleep. #7 Poop! Seriously, having unprocessed stool will prevent sleep and can last for many days. #8 If the other steps don’t work, try meditation. #9 Sex, either with a partner or on your own is about the best sleep medication possible. #10 In extreme cases, self-hypnosis can work miracles, as you ‘train’ your body to relax and flush any outstanding concerns from your mind. You can also us it to automatically wake you at a specific time by using it as a post-hypnotic suggestion. Those work for me. I’ve always had trouble with sleep, which is compounded by diabetic neuropathy of the autonomic nervous system (i.e. all the non-conscious body functions, like sleep, breathing, heart and digestion)."

For anyone finding it difficult to get a good night’s rest - it can be pretty frustrating. The tossing and turning for hours...looking for that sleep-inducing sweet spot but never quite finding it. With each hour that passes and the closer it gets to daylight the more stressed you become. Then it happens...the alarm goes off…and it’s time to start yet another day feeling like absolute hell. Sound familiar? Unfortunately it probably does...that's because over 60 million Americans have trouble sleeping. And I should know, because I was one of them. Hi, my name is Wade Lightheart - I’m the President and CoFounder of BiOptimizers. I’m an advisor to the American Anti-Cancer Institute, a certified sports nutritionist, a 3-time All Natural National Bodybuilding Champion, and a former Mr. Universe Competitor... And I struggled with extreme burnout that completely wrecked my sleep quality. If you’ll stay with me for just a few minutes, I’ll show you exactly what helped me turn the combination of racing thoughts, sleep deprivation, and burnout on its head… You see... For years I was barely able to sleep. It didn’t matter that I was running a business, raising a family, and trying to be all things to all people. Sleep was a luxury I didn’t have and unfortunately I tried to learn how to live without it. But as you can probably guess...that’s NOT exactly possible. In short, my circadian rhythm (aka—my sleep/wake cycle) was out of whack. The circadian rhythm is like a 24-hour clock running in your body. It controls your ability to wake up and function normally throughout the day and then wind down so
                that you can fall asleep. But mine was screwed up. Aside from a few ""catnaps,"" I was up days at a time with no sleep. And for anyone who has ever experienced the joys of late night infomercials and reruns of Barney Miller, you know what I'm talking about. I had to do something and I had to do it fast...but I didn’t know what to do...I’d tried all the popular solutions and nothing worked...but it would be months before I discovered the miracle I'm about to share. Thanks to my business partner Matt. And I promise anyone who tries what he revealed to me will be amazed at both its potent effects and its ease of use. Especially those who feel anxious and worried about their lack of sleep... Experience trouble focusing...

As we age, something that didn’t cause much trouble years ago, might today start triggering stress. And if you already lack sleep, the stress levels can only grow. Here, it is important that everything you do and experience in life affects your sleep quality. For example, your brain’s short-term memory “records” every tiniest vision and thought during the wake-time, and when you sleep, your brain must re-evaluate and self-reorganize this all during deep sleep, saving some data into long-term memory and discarding the rest. Imagine you have seen hundreds of Instagram posts — these all affect your sleep. Naturally, life can be challenging, so if your job includes a lot of visual work, you also need to find ways to calm the visual neural pathway to get better sleep. This is where the second way can help, as by doing neuroeducative movements you can create and promote calmness in the brain. As a result, your brain’s sleep-drive can do its work as well as possible. My Top 5 Ways to Promote Sleep QualityDiet – delicious foods made with quality ingredients, to promote digestive and metabolic health.Activity - do moderate exercises every day, like walking, to promote physical health.Creativity – learn new and develop old skills, to promote brain health.Regularity – organize daily activities following a schedule, to improve time-related physiological processes, including digestion and sleep.Calmness – learn how to calm down and do sleep-inducing activities when you need sleep.From the above, the most powerful and most direct way is to do sleep-inducing movements, because you can directly communicate with your nervous system.

It should be just the right size -- not too fat and not too flat -- to support the natural curve of your neck when you're resting on your back. Do you sleep on your side?

"Go to bed between 10 and 11 PM. Sleep for 7 to 8 hours. If you have problems falling asleep, take 3 to 5 mg of melatonin when you go to sleep. It works within 20 minutes. If this alone does not work, I suspect that you are overstimulated from the happenings of the day. In that cas..."
"How about this,

What is the word “effective” supposed to accomplish?

Do you feel too tired?

Do you want to sleep heavier?

Do you want to wake earlier?

Do you want to fall asleep easier?

Do you want to be more alert and kick ass at work?

What is your sleep lacking now that you don’t feel it is effective?

Take a vicodin and don't get yourself so over your head in debt that all you do is think of how will I pay the next bill. And try sleeping on the floor sometimes. A soft bed is a very miserable place to sleep.
"I have been an insomniac since I was 9 years old; I still have problems, but boy do I have tricks, more than 3 but I’ll give you ones I’ve learned over decades. 1. No Stimulants after sundown: Chocholate, decaf coffee (5% caffeine ), no eating 3 hours before bed time.2. No Stimulants, again, no light, no sound, no TV.

No Stimulants after sundown: Chocholate, decaf coffee (5% caffeine ), no eating 3 hours before bed time.2. No Stimulants, again, no light, no sound, no TV. If you can learn to use them, I buy Soft Squishy earplugs, called “Spark Plugs” from Amazon, 500 at a time in a dispenser; because they work so well. Buy a 10 Pak of shooters ear plugs from a sporting good store to test them out. Get the highest decibel blocking ones you can, roll them between your thumb and forefinger until they easily fit in your ear, they will puff back up, and block all the sounds you don’t know you hear. If you can wear them, put them in backwards for further blocking, yep backwards. They are typically cone shaped, skinny on one side and bigger and flatter on the other, seems like the shape of the ear; they work better when they are put in reversed, assuming you learned to wear them the correct way. Think about it, well try it; they are hard to grab that flat end of the cone to get them out when you wake up…Put the fat end in first, really squished, then the skinny part is sticking out and easy to grab. Plus, the fat part blocks more sound; no brained for me. I should tell them.3. White noise, any boring sound, an air cleaner, a fan against the wall if it’s not hot. Just like mom humming you to sleep.4. No light, already mentioned but as an eye doctor, I know people open their eyes while they sleep, in fact, I’ve had family members video people snoring with their eyes wide open. You typically dream in REM, rapid eye movement, sleep. And guess what you do immediately after your dream, you open your eyes. If you have a sensitivity to light, like I do, even a little LED light on my DVR will wake me up. I keep black electrical tape in my drawer next to the bed just in case if I miss one. I take it, and a roll of black plastic sheeting when I travel. It seems hotels love to put the smoke detector, with the bright red or even worse green light, right over the bed, and it’s 10feet high. So I take a broom, hanger, anything that can reach that light, put a long piece of tape on it, and just cover the light. In the morning, there is lots of sticky tape hanging down from the covered light to snag with the coat hanger. Took me a while to figure that one out, but, it woke me up so many times, I had to find an answer. Oh, I cover every window with the cheap plastic sheeting, and use my black tape, floor to ceiling, or at lease above the window. No blackout curtain blacks out everything. I push all my luggage and furniture along the bottom of the black out, because it never touches the floor.5. Only use your bed for sleeping, that’s what it’s for. Not for a couch, comfortable TV or study location…it is only for sleeping.6. Rotate your mattress every 3 months, then 3 months later flip it over, then 3 months later, rotate it again. Too soft, put a piece of fiberboard (hard board) Masonite, ¼’ thick between the box spring and the mattress. Still too soft, start with ⅜’ plywood.7. Keep a dim, preferably red flashlight next to your bed, with a notepad. So, when you have all those thoughts whirling around in your head, write them down and deal with them tomorrow. RED, flashlight? Yep. Cover it with red cellophane, buy one with a red lens. Ever wonder why darkrooms, submarines, and fighter pilots only have red lights…it doesn’t affect your night vision blinding you when you write your note.8. Make your bed “COMFY”, but not too hot. You sweat when you sleep, which can make you clammy, sticky. I have found, well washed “white”not colored sheets are the most comfortable. I don’t know why the same sheet, colored, isn’t as comfortable. They now have sheets that breathe better than cotton, that’s my next purchase. I’ve tried cooling sheets, cooling pillows, cooling mattress pads. I bought 2 “My Pillow’s” brand, and 2 of their travel pillows with their Geeza cases…They are awesome, I’d go on TV just to tell others how good they are. I think I use the little pillows the most, I now have 4. Between my knees, or under my knees when on my back; in the lumbar, low back position, any place that could use a little anti-roll. They are just nice to lean against.9. No Alcohol just before bed. It will get you to sleep faster, but you will not sleep as well, and I have proof, read the next item.10. A company called RESMED makes a scanner that tracks virtually everything about your s..."

"Generally, under the operation of the biological clock and constant system, at night, our body and brain will gradually enter a state of rest, prompting us to feel sleepy when we should sleep, and then naturally fall asleep easily.

"When my mind is racing clearing/calming my thoughts by repeating a mantra sometimes helps. So does prayer.

If working through the racing mind results in tossing and turning rather than resolution, getting out of bed has always worked for me. Reading, getting something to eat, turning on the PC, watching TV all have been helpful to me in the past. The option of a short walk outside has worked too."
Just to cut down the screen time couple of hours before yoir bed time and physically active in activities . Also Keep your bed clean and neat . These three will definitely help you.

About an hour before you go to bed, start winding down for the evening. Take a bath, read a book, or do something else that relaxes you and helps you prepare for sleep. 3. Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Create an environment that is conducive to sleep by keeping the temperature in your bedroom cool (between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal), dark, and quiet. Consider using blackout curtains or an eye mask to block out light, and earplugs or white noise to reduce any outside noise. 4. Limit your caffeine intake. Caffeine is a stimulant that can make it difficult to fall asleep. If you're struggling with insomnia, avoid caffeine altogether or limit your intake to early in the day. 5. Avoid alcohol before bed. Alcohol may make you feel drowsy at first, but it can actually disrupt your sleep later in the night. If you're struggling with insomnia, it's best to avoid alcohol altogether. 6. Practice some relaxation techniques. Relaxation techniques like mindfulness meditation or progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce stress and promote sleep. 7. Avoid working or using electronic devices in bed. If you can't fall asleep, avoid working or using electronic devices in bed. These activities can stimulate your mind and make it more difficult to fall asleep. 8. Get up and move around if you can't sleep. If you find yourself lying in bed awake, it's best to get up and move around for a bit. Walking around or doing some light stretching can help you relax and may make it easier to fall asleep. 9. See a doctor if you're still having trouble sleeping. If you're regularly having difficulty sleeping, it's important to see a doctor. Insomnia can be a symptom of an underlying health condition, so it's important to get any potential health issues checked out."

When you are happy and going to bed without any disturbance. If you keep your entire day busy with work you will get the best sleep in the night with the points things mentioned. Do not go to bed with empty stomach. Go to room for sleep with open air and dark room.
To get my absolute best sleep I take melatonin an hour before my goal to be asleep or before I'm brushing my teeth. If I don have melatonin ill lay in bed make sure all the lights are off that meditate. You can use a meditation video or focus on your breathing and close your eyes. If none of this works ill turn on some rain sounds and try the breathing techniques again. Hope this helps.
"The only way I get any sleep is with medication. Dr.s prescribed it and before I knew it, I was addicted to it. I wish the FDA never approved these drugs and the drug companies didn’t give pay offs to the Dr.s to prescribe it. Then I get blamed for following Dr.s orders."
"Let us understand the concepts for optimizing sleep.Relax - Supplements and biohacks aside, you can try a series of simple yoga moves, moves that you can perform by your bedside, accompanied by deep, nasal breathing.

You can keep the lights dim, switch to incandescent red bulbs instead of flourescent or LED lighting, or even adopt the use of nighttime candles in your bedroom. You can finish any hard workouts 3 hours before bed to keep the body’s core temperature low.Read - Once you are relaxed, crawl into bed and grab a bedside book that isn’t about topics that get you excited, such as fitness or business, but instead are relaxing, philosophical or fictional reads that charm your mind with positive, affirmative thoughts prior to bed. Ideally, these books should not be consumed on a Kindle, smartphone, or any other e-reader due to the presence of light that can shut down your natural melatonin product, but rather in paper form.Meditate or Pray - I often simply close my eyes, and, along with my wife—with whom I keep a bedside list of family members, friends, and topics to bring to God—utter a few simple prayers of gratitude, praise, and supplication to God. If there is any sin harbored in my heart, especially anger or feelings of unrest towards any people in my life, I bring those feelings to God in a spirit of confession and repentance.Breathe - While there are a multitude of forms of relaxing breathwork, two of my favorites are a ""double-inhale-toexhale"" and a ""4-7-8"" pattern. For the former, breaking up one long inhale as a double inhale through your nose and then exhaling through your mouth can calm you instantly.Trust - Fall asleep with a smile on your face, trusting God that he will provide for tomorrow."
"My son and I were watching this Netflix documentary where a unique slimy insect called ""velvet worm"", almost unchanged from the age of dinosaurs was found in a million-year-old dense forest.

What is unique about velvet worms is it traps its prey by spraying glue from its ""glue guns"", almost like a tiny little unknown spider man in the woods.This got me thinking. If velvet worms were spider men, we are GLUE MEN (like someone told me). We don't send out glues to trap people but we ARE the glue. Everything that comes across us gets stuck to us. Our parents, our childhood experiences, traumas, work pressure, even things like cars, houses, money everything. And at the end of the day, our faces are long, our free spirit weighed down by all these objects stuck to us. Is it the object's fault? It is NOT the object's fault. It is ours. Because we are the super-sticky attaching GLUE MEN. And that is exactly why a little kid can jump and hop around with no worries in his head. He has no baggage. Imagine how free will it be if we could simply turn into a non-sticky person or in other words KEEP OUR BAGGAGE DOWN. After all, if we can take and carry the baggage with us, we can consciously keep it down too. Keeping it down doesn't mean you can't love your wife or love your car. Just every night, before you go to sleep, lying on your bed, close your eyes and consciously ONE BY ONE keep anything down that has gotten stuck to you. In the morning, you can pick it up, Sure. Don't feel the grip of guilt. But for now, just do this. Fill this blank I am not ________ _with anything that is stuck to you and say to yourself mentally and believe it. ( for example ) . . I am not a husband I am not a doctor I am not my fears I am not this mind I am not this body You can FILL THIS BLANK I am not _________ WITH ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING that you can think of that weighs you down and say to yourself believing it. You will sense the baggage leaving you slowly and feel lighter and lighter, breathing will become deeper and you will fall into a great slumber peacefully. Rest assured.

This will help your mind and body relax for bedtime. — Avoid screens in the evening: The light from screens can reduce the amount of melatonin your body releases, which delays and disrupts your sleep cycle."

Your breathing is closely related to the brain [mind] and gives relief from stress-insomnia. For a relaxed mind observe the sensations of your incoming--outgoing breath at the entrance of the nostrils for 10-15-20 minutes or more. You can sit or lie down, anywhere-anytime with eyes closed. Never meditate with expectations but with awareness. No deep breathing. Don’t fight your thoughts. With practice the mind will relax. Keep a reminder to observe your breath sensations throughout the day and night --before sleep, when reading, at work, at home, when travelling etc with eyes open or closed. Like me make this a lifetime habit to have a better life. Best wishes--Counsellor."

This rhythm helps your body prepare for sleep. Work, children, and other demands on your time may determine your rhythm. Many sleepers, especially night owls, may be tempted to sleep in longer on weekends. Try to keep the same wake-up time, even on weekends.

Establish a regular bedtime and wake up timeYou will sleep the most soundly if you go to bed and wake up around the same times every day. This rhythm helps your body prepare for sleep. Work, children, and other demands on your time may determine your rhythm. Many sleepers, especially night owls, may be tempted to sleep in longer on weekends. Try to keep the same wake-up time, even on weekends. If you have been sleep deprived, you may need a little extra sleep for a few nights. If you are sick, let yourself sleep extra. Reestablish your sleep routines as soon as you can. 2. Determine your natural sleep schedule.If you have the freedom to determine your own sleep schedule, do so around the rhythms of your body. Your body has natural waking and sleeping moments. Notice the when you feel sleepy, and when you feel the most awake. To establish a natural sleep rhythm, spend a week or two waking up without an alarm clock. Keep a log with all the times you wake up. Keep a parallel account of the times at night you feel sleepy enough to put yourself to bed. You may find that these numbers become more consistent after a few days without your alarm. Formalize your bedtime. Once you have established your natural waking and falling asleep times, set a routine around them. Wake up and fall asleep on that schedule consistently. If your natural sleep routine seems to be inconsistent, you may need to experiment with setting different bedtimes and seeing which ones feel best. ""Morning"" people tend to have an easier time setting their sleep schedules. If you tend to be more energetic in the evening, you may just need to set a sleep time. Make sure your formalized sleep schedule gives you the right amount of sleep. If it doesn't, your numbers may be off. 3. Sleep enough.Most adults need to sleep between seven and nine hours a night. Teenagers need eight to 10 hours of sleep, and school-aged children need at least 10 hours. Sleeping too little can expose you to higher risks of illness, anxiety, and disease. Sleeping too much, however, may reduce the quality of your sleep and may actually leave you feeling groggy when you wake up. 4. .Stay asleep Do everything in your power to avoid waking up at night. This can be difficult if you are an evening person, if you have children, or if you are a light sleeper. Making arrangements in your bedroom and winding down properly can make a huge difference, but so can prioritizing staying asleep. Tell yourself and tell everyone you live with that you need to stay asleep all night. Limit liquids in the hours before bed if you are someone who gets up to use the bathroom during the night. Remove as many distractions as possible (as detailed in part two) to make a sleep-friendly environment. Lights, sounds, and anything else that might wake you up should be eliminated. Older adults still need seven to eight hours of sleep, but may sleep more lightly and wake up frequently. If you are elderly, take naps and spend a little more time in bed than eight hours. If you have a baby under a year old, sleep deprivation is part of the deal. You can help by maintaining a few boundaries. Establish a wakeup schedule with your partner or other adult sharing parenting duties with you. Your baby should sleep in their own crib, though you may bring your baby into bed for nighttime nursing. Try waiting the baby out for the first few fusses or cries. Don't ignore the fussing, but give it a chance—a few minutes of noise might just mean your baby is settling down. 5. Wind down the same way every night.6. Get up briefly if you don't immediately fall asleep.Although you are best off getting in bed and falling asleep at the same time every night, some nights you can't fall asleep right away. If you haven't fallen asleep after 15 minutes, get up and do a brief, relaxing activity. Read a magazine, do some gentle stretches, or listen to a. Then put yourself to bed again as soon as you feel sleepy. Laying in bed and stressing about how you can't fall asleep can keep you awake and can create an association between your bed and feeling anxious. Getting up and doing something else can help ensure you only associate your bed with sleeping. If this happens frequently, you may need to adjust your sleep schedule. 7. Turn off your alarm.Alarms interfere with your quality of sleep. Try training yourself to wake up at the same time every morning, but if you can't rely on your natural body clock, go ahead and set an alarm. 8. Use your bed for sleep only. It may be tempting to do work, read, watch TV, or play with your phone in bed, but this may make it hard for you to fall asleep when it's time to go to bed. Try to use your bed only for sleeping or sexual activity so that your body makes an association that when you hit the mattress, it's time for sleep. Part 2 of 3:Setting Up a Sleep-Friendly Environment1. Keep your room dark at night.Get good curtains to block streetlight, and consider getting blackout curtains if you are really disturbed by light. Eliminate light sources in your bedroom — anything that emits light should be turned to face the wall, covered, or turned off. Nightlights are a bad idea. In the hours before you sleep, dim the lights in your house and avoid screens. If you share a room with someone who needs lights on in the morning or after you have gone to bed, sleep with a soft cotton sleep mask. Light inhibits the production of melatonin, a hormone that makes you feel tired. The light emitted from electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops is particularly stimulating, preventing your body from making melatonin and making it very difficult for you to fall asleep. Try to avoid using these devices before bed. 2. Stop noise pollution.Though some ambient noise may be comforting, you are less likely to sleep well in a house full of irregular noises. Consider earplugs if you live with other people. Set a noise policy with your housemates or family that will keep the house quiet at nighttime. The sound of a fan or white noise machine may help you fall asleep and stay asleep. White noise combines sounds of many different frequencies, which can mask other sounds that might disrupt your sleep or wake you up. 3. Cool down.Piling on blankets may make you feel sleepy, but being overheated can actually interfere with your sleep. Regulate your room's temperature and toss off blankets if you are hot. Sleep naked if you feel comfortable doing so, so your body can self-regulate its temperature. Lower the heat at night. Your core temperature goes down at night, so keeping your room cool will help you stay comfortable. Some people believe that taking a cool shower at night may help you fall asleep, as it lowers the body's temperature to the level it's at when you sleep. 4. Nest in a supportive bed.The quality of your mattress and pillow can affect your sleep. You will sleep best on a mattress that feels right to you. Your mattress may need replacing every seven years, or earlier if it is sagging or uncomfortable. If you wake up with a sore neck or back, or if you sleep better in other places than you do at home, you may need a new mattress. Make sure your bed is the right length and width. If you are sharing a bed, make sure there is space for both of you to move naturally. Set limits with pets and children if sharing your bed wakes you up or crowds you. 5. Keep your room clear.It's hard to relax in a cluttered room. Tidy up at night, and put away anything that reminds you of daily cares. Your work should be out of sight. Remove any unnecessary belongings from your room, and store them elsewhere. Keep a clear path between your bed and the door. Part 3 of 3:Making Lifestyle Changes to Promote Better Sleep1. Nap briefly and rarely.Unless you are a baby or an elderly person, napping will lower the quality of your sleep. If you must nap, keep it under 30 minutes. Long naps will make you sleepy all day and wakeful at night. Take your naps in the mid afternoon. This is the time least likely to disturb your sleep schedule. 2. Exercise.During the day, get out your natural physical energy. Go for a run, a walk, or a long bike ride. Get at least 150 minutes of exercise a week if you are a healthy adult. Get a mix of aerobic activity and strength exercises, and break up all periods of sitting with breaks in which you move. Cease all vigorous exercise in the two hours before you sleep. Exercising too close to your bedtime may make it difficult for you to fall asleep. Moderate stretching and walking in the evening will not interfere with sleep. 3. Eat the right amount.Going to bed hungry or stuffed will disrupt your sleep. Try to finish your eating two to three hours before you go to bed. If you are prone to stomach acid, be especially vigilant about this. If it's been four or five hours since you've eaten, however, eat a light snack before you settle down. Try a slice of wheat toast with peanut butter, which can help you feel satisfied and may even promote sleepiness. 4. Limit caffeine and alcohol consumption.Caffeine may interfere with your sleep if ingested within the six hours before bedtime. Avoid coffee and tea in the evening, as well as caffeinated soda and dark chocolate. If you are having an alcoholic drink, have it at least an hour before bedtime. For every drink you have, add another hour for your body to process the alcohol. For example, if you go to bed at 10 and you want to have two drinks, finish drinking them by 8. Although alcohol can help you feel tired and relaxed, it actually interferes with the quality of your sleep. Alcohol plunges you into deep sleep, pushing you past the REM stage and causing you to wake up early and unrested. It can also cause you to urinate, sweat, and snore, all of which can disturb your sleep. If you like a warm drink at night, try herbal tea, warm milk, or just warm water. 5. Just say no to meds, drugs, and cigarettes.Sleep medication can interfere with the quality of your sleep and the consistency of your sleep routine, so it's best to avoid it if possible. If you practice good sleep hygiene and are still unable to fall asleep, you may want to talk to your doctor about short-term use of sleeping medications. Avoid smoking or doing drugs before bedtime. 6. Manage stressStress and worry will keep you up at night. Establishing a consistent wind-down routine will help you communicate to yourself that it is time to sleep. If you are plagued by thoughts of things you need to do, keep a pad by your bed where you can jot them down before you go to sleep. After you write them down, remind yourself that you cannot worry about them right now. Tell yourself ""Now is not the time to solve problems. I can do that in the morning. Now I just have to sleep."" 7. Get regular checkups. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute reports that certain medical conditions have been linked to poor quality sleep, such as heart failure, heart disease, obesity, stroke, depression and ADHD. If you treat the disease/disorder, your sleep may also improve. See your doctor at least once a year for a checkup to rule out these possibilities."

Let's explore them:Stick to a Consistent Sleep Schedule: Our bodies love routine, so try to establish a regular sleep schedule. Aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock and promotes better sleep.Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment: Your sleep environment plays a significant role in the quality of your rest. Make your bedroom a cozy and relaxing sanctuary. Ensure the room is cool, quiet, and dark. Consider investing in comfortable pillows, a supportive mattress, and soft bedding.Wind Down with a Relaxing Routine: Establish a pre-sleep routine that helps you unwind and signals to your body that it's time to sleep. Engage in calming activities such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. Find what relaxes you and make it a nightly habit.Limit Stimulants and Screens: Avoid consuming stimulants like caffeine or nicotine close to bedtime, as they can interfere with falling asleep. Additionally, the blue light emitted by electronic devices can disrupt your sleep patterns. Try to avoid screens at least an hour before bed or use blue light filters.Engage in Regular Exercise: Regular physical activity can contribute to better sleep. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. However, avoid intense workouts too close to bedtime, as they may leave you feeling energized instead of ready to sleep.Manage Stress and Relax: High levels of stress can interfere with sleep. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or gentle yoga. Creating a peaceful mindset before bed can help calm your thoughts and prepare you for sleep.Watch Your Diet and Hydration: Be mindful of what and when you eat.

Consider using white noise machines, earplugs, or eye masks if they help you relax and block out distractions.Limit Daytime Napping: While a short power nap can be refreshing, avoid long daytime snoozes, as they can interfere with your ability to fall asleep at night. If you feel the need to nap, keep it brief (around 20-30 minutes) and earlier in the day.Seek Professional Help if Needed: If you consistently struggle with sleep problems or suspect you have a sleep disorder, it may be beneficial to consult a healthcare professional or sleep specialist. They can provide guidance, diagnose any underlying issues, and recommend appropriate treatments.Remember, finding the techniques that work best for you may involve some trial and error.

They can have side effects and might not address the root cause of your sleep issues.Establish a Wake-up Routine: Just as a bedtime ritual can help you fall asleep, a consistent wake-up routine (e.g., stretching, hydrating, and exposing yourself to natural light) can help you start the day right.Evaluate Your Sleep Environment: Factors such as a partner's snoring, a lumpy mattress, or a pet in the bed can affect sleep quality. Make necessary changes to ensure a sleep-conducive environment.Seek Professional Help: If you've tried various strategies and still struggle with sleep, consider seeking help from a sleep specialist. Conditions like sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, or insomnia might be the underlying cause.Making some or all of these adjustments can lead to better sleep quality and increased daily functioning and well-being."

"Not me. I actually noticed that working out made me sleepy and I got a good sleep at night. But to each his own, I guess. I never tried sleeping during the day since my workplace isn't that liberal, so sorry I couldn't help on that one!"
"Working the night shift messes with your internal biological clock.  Your body is crying out for sleep but you're doing the opposite: working.  One would beel tired during the next day, if in fact they don't nap.  It's hard to sleep in the day because of all the noise, bright sun, and distractions also. Some get used to it, some never do."

I sleep deeply, all night every night, pretty much. :) I do think that sleep patterns are largely related to age and genetic make-up. Babies and teenagers sleep a lot, but at odd times. Older people may not need to sleep as much (I am an exception to this). But obviously there are a few things that can enhance almost anyone’s —except extreme outliers—experiences: Go out and be in the sun in the morning and middle of the day. This sets your circadian rhythms properly and leads to a natural cycle of rest later on. Don’t nap in the daytime. I am congenitally incapable of doing this but I know some people do. I don't get it. How can you be properly tired at night if you sleep in the day? Exercise and get tired. ((duh :)) Don’t eat or drink anything but a bit of water for at least two hours before going to bed. For drinks, particularly avoid sweet drinks or alcohol in this timeframe. How can you sleep well if your stomach is fighting a lot of food to digest or having the chemical swings of sugar or alcohol? Bed is for sex and sleep. No books, no tv in bedroom/sight, and especially no iPhone. People really mess themselves up with the screen lights waking up their brains. This is where people need to discipline themselves. Most people just don’t want to give up these habits . . . :( Never go to bed angry. Sometimes things may be irresolvable before bedtime but it is enough to speak and say “let’s talk about this more tomorrow. We can’t resolve it now. Sleeping on it will help us calm down and get it solved. “ Go to bed at a fairly regular time each night, workday or weekend. Exceptions are fine but be generally regular. This really helps. Start turning things down—-lights, stimulating conversations, provocative media—for an hour or so before going to bed. Are you a night bath person or morning shower person? I am a morning shower person. But, I will sometimes take a relaxing warming bath before bedtime. Not a big deal but just a few minutes to warm my body in the winter. (Yes, this may be influenced by living in Japan. It is not only the norm here but all homes have deep bathtubs for this very purpose.) Room should be cool for relaxing sleep. I don’t wear restrictive or many clothes to bed but have appropriate covers. I tend to like a heavier cover but some do better with lofty light duvets. Bed should be somewhat firm. Too soft a bed will make you tired and not sleep well. We sleep on a big futon flat on the floor (tatami-rice matting) so maybe harder than most . . . Most Important Point (and this is where I think most people fail): develop a strategy for gradually turning off your brain. I do this by saying goodnight lovingly to the whole family, turning off the light, mentally committing to this moment of Going to Sleep, turning over on my side, tucking the covers around me. a couple of deep breaths (sighs), and then I start mentally knitting. Yes, knitting. It is Second Nature to me and the most relaxing and meditative thing I know. Within a few stitches I am deeply asleep. What is your “knitting” . . . that thing that soothes you, that is your balm and therapy? That is the thing you should think about in order to sleep. I hope that these tips help people to take common-sense steps to improve their sleep. I know that some people have trouble “turning off” their brains or may be genetically hard-wired to insomnia. I still think some of these tips may help a bit . . . :)"

Insomnia is difficult for me to “cure” or even manage because it’s a direct consequence of who I am. As such, it demands from me, even beyond consistent effort, a transformation. To put it in other words, if you’re looking for an easy answer, one that offers “insomnia hacks”, this is not that. Here are some things that help me sleep better. Avoiding caffeine. I drink one cup of coffee in the morning, and then (try to) stay away from the stuff for the rest of the day. Caffeine lurks in unsuspecting places so I read the ingredients of anything I put in my mouth. Limiting my sugar intake. In my personal, empirical experience, the less sugar I consume the better I sleep. I wish I could tell you this has resulted in me giving up sugar, but no. Regular exercise. I need to tire myself out and being tired from work is brain-tired, thought-tired, not body tired. I need to be all-tired. When I’m brain-tired she convinces the rest of me that I’m too tired to work out. I now know that when my brain says “take a break! You’re too tired” that’s when I need to go to the gym the most. I practice yoga. Deep breathing and moving through poses helps me manage two of my biggest shadows: anxiety and stress. I try to stay away from light and devices once I get to bed. I’m terrible at this because I am really into scrolling through my phone. It sort of soothes me to feel connected. Please don’t do this. I have the light on my phone on the night setting 24 hours a day. This is just to make me feel better. I’m not claiming it does anything but maybe it’s gentler on my eyes. I attempt to wind down early. I don’t do anything that would unsettle me. A good example of this is a TV show that is suspenseful. It makes me restless and leaks into my dreams. Everything leaks into my dreams. I watch my general health. I get regular medical check ups and keep an eye out for anything that tends to reoccur, such as thyroid hormone fluctuations. I sleep (or lie) on a sturdy mattress and have good pillows. My room is, for the most part, quiet, dark and cool. I never work in bed – not even a “quick catch up”, and have never had a TV in my bedroom. If I can’t sleep I get up. I pad around my dark apartment and then sit down in a quiet corner with my soft blanket and read something that is not on a screen. I take deep breaths. I get into yoga poses that are calming. I try not to do anything stimulating, which unfailingly reminds me I find everything stimulating. At 3:00 a.m., as I lie flat on my living room floor with my legs up against the wall, my curly tangle of hair fanned out around my head, trying to take full, long, abdominal breaths it hits me I am becoming increasingly eccentric. Over the years I have made drastic lifestyle changes that divorce me from anything that keeps me up at night that I decide is simply not worth losing sleep over. I realize that sometimes being kept up cannot be avoided, but I have found it’s always worth asking myself what I can do to change things so that I can sleep. If my job is disrupting my sleep, maybe it’s the wrong job. It’s worth the analysis. Sometimes this analysis keeps me up. Maybe it’s a night invested instead of a night lost. This same process of selection goes for my behavior. Guilt, shame and regret are mostly nocturnal visitors. What do I need to do differently to keep them away? When I sleep better I notice it’s an indication that my life is in a good place. And maybe that’s why I was given insomnia. It’s an early sign that something better be adjusted. In the coal mine that is my night, sleep is the canary."

Sharing six tips to help you sleep well, he also speaks about the Shambhavi Mahamudra, which blurs the line between being asleep and awake.Sadhguru: Do you find that one day morning when you get up, without any reason you are just feeling ugly? If it is happening even two or three times a year, then you must do certain things before you go to bed. It is very important. You can unconsciously incubate a lot of either negative or positive things in sleep. You can incubate either pleasantness or unpleasantness in an uninterrupted way very effectively in sleep. You can also incubate it during the day, but there are so many interruptions that it does not happen very efficiently. But if you have a tendency to go to bed in a certain way and you wake up in the morning feeling really nasty for simply no reason, that means you are incubating bad eggs in the night very efficiently. This is not just about psychological disturbances; it can cause major physiological problems over a period of time. It is important that you eliminate these things from your life. So before you go to bed in the night, there are certain things that you need to take care of. Tip #1: Take a Shower Always shower before you go to bed. It will make a lot of difference. Maybe cold showers are difficult in cold weather, so take a lukewarm shower, but do not go for hot showers in the night. A cold shower will keep you alert. You will sleep twenty minutes or half an hour later, but you will sleep better because it will take away certain things. When you shower, it is not just the dirt on the skin that you are taking away. Have you noticed, if you are very tense and anxious, after taking a shower, you come out feeling almost like a burden has been taken away from you? It is not just about washing the skin. A whole lot of things happen when water flows over your body. Taking a shower is a very rudimentary bhuta shuddhi because over seventy percent of your body is actually water. If you run water over it, a certain purification happens which is beyond cleaning the skin. Tip #2: Don’t Sleep Right After a Meal If you are eating meat and other kinds of meals, it is best to eat at least three to four hours before you go to bed so that the digestion is over. Before going to bed, drink a certain amount of water; you will see that it gets taken care of. Tip #3: Light a Lamp One more thing you can do is just light an organic oil lamp. Use a cotton wick, do not use something else. You can use linseed oil, rice-bran oil, sesame oil, olive oil or any organic oil with a cotton wick. Just light one little lamp somewhere in the room where you sleep and you will see that these things will completely disappear. Tip #4: Remember That Time Is Running Out! Keep this in your mind that you are truly a mortal. Not just in words, really see that you could fall dead right now. I will bless you with a long life, but it is possible that you or me could fall dead right now. Please be conscious of this. This is not to create fear or paranoia but just to know the reality. If you know, ""I am truly mortal and my time is so limited,"" you will have no time to be angry, to quarrel with someone, or to do anything that does not really matter to you. If you are conscious of your mortality, you will do only what you truly care for in your life. Before you go to bed, sit on your bed with the thought that this is your deathbed and you have just one more minute to live. Just look back and see, what you have done today, is it worthwhile? Just do this one simple exercise. And when it really happens, who knows whether you will be sitting on your deathbed or lying in a hospital with all kinds of things sticking into you. So enjoy this every day that you sit on your deathbed, look back and see, ""Today, the way I have handled these twenty-four hours, is it worthwhile because now I am dying?"" If you do this, you will live a worthwhile life, believe me. Tip #5: Keep Things Aside Just do this before you go to bed. In the last three minutes, keep aside everything that you have gathered – the body, the content of the mind, and the small things. Do not ignore small things; these small things are big things. I have seen how people are carrying their own private pillow because it is very important. Your pillow, your footwear, if you have relationships, everything that you have gathered – keep it aside and sleep. If you manage to sleep like that, you will wake up with something else altogether different. You will wake up with much more light, energy and possibilities than you have imagined possible. Just sleep as life – not as a man or woman, not as this and that. Simply keep everything down. Tip #6: Do Not “Head North” If you put your head to the north and sleep during the night in a horizontal position, then slowly the blood will get pulled towards your brain. When there is too much circulation in the brain, you cannot sleep peacefully. If you have any kind of inherently weak aspects in your brain or if you are of old age, you could die in your sleep. One can have hemorrhage because extra blood is trying to enter the brain where the blood vessels are hairlike. Something extra is being pushed because of the magnetic pull of the planet. When you are in a vertical position, this is not so. The moment you become horizontal, this pull on the head is strong. This is true only in the northern hemisphere. If you go to Australia, you should not put your head to the south. If you are in India you should not put your head to the north. It is okay if you put it any other way. Question: I tend to have a lot of visions in my sleep. I was wondering if you could talk about that? Sadhguru: Once, a burglar was caught stealing and he was taken to the court. On the surface, this man was well-to-do, so the judge asked him, “You have enough in life. Why are you stealing from other people?” The burglar said, “Well, you know, the wise have always said, ‘Whatever a man may have, he always wants more.’” The judge looked at him and said, “Okay. I give you 10 years. If you want more, tell me.” At least in sleep, do not look for more. It would be fantastic if you did not look for more in wakefulness either – simply be. If that is not possible for you right now, at least in sleep, do not ask for more – simply sleep. You can make sleep into a phenomenally productive process so that you will need less sleep. If you sleep in absolute relaxation, the gene expression and other processes in the body will happen more quickly and more efficiently. That means you will wake up sooner. If you are inefficient in wakefulness, it is not good, but we will bear with you. But if you are inefficient even in sleep, death will be the only answer, because that is the only area where you cannot be inefficient. When you die, you die. If you learn to simply sleep, to “simply be” in wakefulness will be the next step. Sleep is a state where you are on the edge between the world of sounds and the world of silence, but you can only move into the world of silence when you are aware. You can move through the world of sounds and forms unaware, but you cannot move into the world of silence, which is devoid of any vibration, devoid of any forms, in unawareness. How to Improve Sleep Quality We want to use sleep as a platform for awakening, to become one with all that is real – not as a way to become inert, dead, and away from all that is real. Improving sleep quality does not mean sleeping like a stone. But actually, a stone is the wrong example, because in my experience, stones are very alive – a lot more alive than many human beings. “Sleeping like a log” would be a better expression, because a log is dead – it is not a tree anymore. This is not about sleeping like a log, but about sleeping in a live manner – being awake and asleep at the same time. If you bring even a small percentage of this element into your sleep, you will naturally become meditative over a period of time. Meditation, not as an act but as a quality, will become a part of your existence. Shambhavi Mahamudra We have tried to bring this aspect into people’s life in so many ways, starting with the Shambhavi Mahamudra. Shambhavi means twilight – you are between day and night, night and day. Twilight means you are asleep, but you are awake; you are awake, but you are asleep. Changing the quality of our sleep – not the quantum – is the necessary foundation for someone to become a Yogi. In wakefulness, you must be fully awake but if you check the parameters of the body, it must be asleep. In sleep, your body should sleep, your mind should sleep, but you must be awake. Sleep – Your Way to True Aliveness Aliveness is not an acquired state – it is your nature. “Just being” means being absolute life – not a mind, not a thought, not an emotion, not an ideology, not a philosophy, not a belief system, not a gender, not a race, not a caste, not a creed – just life. If you touch life on this level, you will know by experience that life and the source of life are packed inside each other. If you sit here just as a piece of life, there will be no separation between yourself and the Divine. If you cannot simply be yet, at least when you are asleep, simply sleep. It will do many miraculous things. If only you could be awake and asleep at once, you would be in the lap of the Divine for always.

Use blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine to block out any disruptive noises or light. Ensure your mattress, pillows, and bedding are comfortable and supportive. 3. Establish a Relaxing Bedtime Routine: Develop a relaxing routine before bed to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. Engage in calming activities such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, practicing relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing or meditation), or listening to soothing music. 4. Limit Exposure to Electronics: Avoid using electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops before bed. The blue light emitted by these devices can interfere with your sleep by suppressing the production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Try to limit screen time at least one hour before bed. 5. Manage Stress: Practice stress management techniques to help reduce anxiety and promote better sleep. This may include engaging in regular physical exercise, journaling, talking to a trusted friend or therapist, or practicing relaxation techniques like yoga or mindfulness meditation. 6. Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment: Ensure your bedroom is comfortable and free of distractions. Keep the room cool, well-ventilated, and free from excessive noise. Use a comfortable mattress, pillows, and bedding that suit your preferences and provide proper support. 7. Avoid Stimulants: Limit or avoid the consumption of stimulants such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, especially in the evening. These substances can interfere with sleep quality and disrupt your ability to fall asleep or stay asleep. 8. Regular Exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity, preferably earlier in the day, can promote better sleep. However, avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime, as it may stimulate your body and make it more challenging to wind down for sleep. 9. Evaluate Your Bedroom Lighting: Use low-wattage, soft, and warm-colored lighting in your bedroom during the evening. Bright or harsh lighting can interfere with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle. 10. Consult a Healthcare Professional: If you consistently struggle with poor sleep despite implementing these strategies, consider seeking advice from a healthcare professional. They can evaluate any underlying sleep disorders or conditions that may be affecting your sleep quality and provide appropriate guidance or treatment. Remember, improving sleep quality often involves adopting healthy lifestyle habits and creating a conducive sleep environment. It may take time to establish new routines and habits, so be patient and consistent in implementing these practices."

Many people aren’t, and they don’t even realize what they are missing out on. It may seem like once you know how to sleep well, your body will do it by itself, but there are actually some steps that you can take to improve your sleep quality and ensure that you wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day ahead. Here are some things that I do to improve my sleep quality each night.Set a Sleep Schedule: This is probably one of the easiest ways you can start improving your sleeping habits. Set yourself up for a set bedtime and wake-up time, both on weekdays and weekends. You might want to start with even more rigid boundaries than you think—for example, if your body tends to shut down at 10pm at night, try setting your alarm for 9:30pm instead.Track your sleep: These days, there are an abundance of tools available for tracking your sleep. Whether you prefer a wearable, or an app on your phone, it’s relatively easy to get an idea of how well (or not) you’re sleeping. The important thing is to keep track of your results; over time, by monitoring and comparing your results with other periods in which you think you slept better or worse than usual, you can develop insight into what factors affect your sleep and how they may change in different contexts.Reduce Screen Time Before Bed: Studies have shown that watching television and using other forms of screen time just before bed can affect your circadian rhythm and overall sleep quality. It’s best to avoid these kinds of devices for at least a few hours before hitting snooze, so go ahead and plug in your phone when you get home from work. You may notice better rest after cutting out screen time close to bedtime!Try Deep Breathing Exercises: Breathing exercises are a proven way to calm down and help your body relax. By practicing deep breathing, you can re-oxygenate your blood and relieve muscle tension while lowering stress levels. Deep breathing also helps reduce anxiety, which is a major contributor to poor sleep.Invest in a high-quality mattress: A mattress is one of your most valuable pieces of furniture, but one you probably don’t spend much time thinking about. One of my favorite mattress brands, Sunday Rest, has built a strong reputation for building high-quality mattresses without sacrificing comfort or durability. If you’re having trouble sleeping and think it may be related to your mattress, try a Sunday Rest to see if it helps for which they have a 100-night risk-free trial policy too.Sunday Rest offers three types of mattresses to its customers:Sunday Ortho Memory Foam mattressSunday Ortho Latex mattressSunday Latex Plus mattressFor those who are not aware about Sunday Rest, in the year 2021 their mattresses were ranked as the best mattress that one can buy in India by renowned publications like The Week Magazine and New Indian Express.Invest in high-quality bedding accessories: Apart from mattresses, Sunday Rest also makes high-quality bedding accessories that includes:Sunday Delight PillowSunday Mattress TopperSunday Mattress Protector CoverInvesting in a high-quality mattress and bedding products from Sunday Rest is really worth it, because they’re comfy and supportive. Mattresses paired with their bedding accessories, you can get exactly what you need to make sure you get through each day feeling refreshed!Some other reasons of buying products from Sunday Rest includes:10-years warranty on all mattresses and 1-years warranty on all bedding products100-nights risk-free trial policyTransparent Pricing policy100% organic cotton cover with all mattressesHypoallergenic productsHigh-quality certified foams and raw materials usedFree and fast shipping24*7 Customer supportConclusion: All of these methods have worked for me in one way or another, but as with most things related to health and wellness, there is no one right answer. Try different things out and find what works best for you. Whatever you decide, focus on small steps; finding time to exercise can be hard enough as it is! Start by making a couple changes at a time so you’re not overwhelmed and always moving forward. Once you’ve settled into your new habits, take on more!"

Several recommended methods can positively impact sleep patterns, leading to more restful and rejuvenating slumber. Incorporating exercise and maintaining a regular sleep schedule are two fundamental approaches that can make a significant difference. Regular physical activity has been shown to promote better sleep quality. Engaging in moderate aerobic exercises, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, for at least 30 minutes most days of the week can help regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Exercise helps reduce stress and anxiety, both of which can disrupt sleep. However, it is essential to avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime, as it may have a stimulating effect. Consistency is key to improving sleep quality. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends, helps synchronize the body's internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up naturally. Creating a bedtime routine can signal to the body that it is time to wind down and prepare for sleep. Activities such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing can promote a calmer mind and better sleep. For individuals suffering from insomnia, cannabidiol (CBD) has gained attention as a potential aid for better sleep. CBD is a non-psychoactive compound derived from the cannabis plant, and it may have calming and anxiety-reducing effects. Some studies have explored the use of CBD for sleep disorders. For instance, a 2019 study published in The Permanente Journal found that adults with anxiety and poor sleep experienced notable improvements after taking CBD. However, more research is needed to understand the long-term effects and safety of CBD for sleep. While these methods can be beneficial, it's important to remember that individual responses to sleep interventions may vary. If sleep problems persist or worsen, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional. They can provide personalized advice and assess whether any underlying medical or psychological conditions may be affecting sleep quality. In conclusion, improving sleep quality involves adopting healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular exercise and consistent sleep schedules. For those with insomnia or sleep disturbances, CBD may be a potential option, but further research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety. Prioritizing sleep and making positive changes to bedtime routines can go a long way in promoting better sleep and enhancing overall well-being.

"Personally, I enjoy being awake when I cannot fall asleep. I use that time to do things I enjoy and time flies when you are enjoying it! Before you know it, you will find you are too sleepy to continue having a good time at whatever it is you like to do. EX: Read, work a puzzle, watch a good movie, meditate, etc."

I tried several tips to improve my sleep, but they weren't enough to solve the problem. Finally, I found the cause and the solution that tackles it directly. My search for a solution is over. I suffered from not being able to fall fast asleep for many years. It normally took me an hour or more. While I was awake in bed, my mind was everywhere. I thought it was a bad habit. I believed that I had so many thoughts because of my body condition. So, I tried to solve it by changing physical conditions.These are the things I tried to sleep better: Drinking warm milk before I go to bed. Turning off all the lights to keep my room dark. Stopping watching YouTube in bed since it keeps my nerves awake. Keeping a daily routine, so that my body knows when to sleep and when to wake up. They were useful. But they helped me only partially and temporarily. It wasn’t until I started meditation that I realized I had to pay more attention to the causes than the physical symptom itself. And in my case, the causes are from my mind, not from the body condition. The first action I took was to identify the causes and get rid of them through meditation. When I meditated, I reflected on what was going on in my mind while in bed. Things from the day were flooding back to my mind. My thoughts were like these: “I said that to him and now I regret it. What would he think about me? I wish I could turn the clock backward.” “I’m so proud of myself about what I said today. It was such a brilliant line to say.” “She was so arrogant. How could she tell me such things?“ And I hated myself who wasn’t able to speak up. And all other random thoughts from the past and about the future came up as well. With reflection, I was able to admit that I was very self-conscious. I got rid of the thoughts and concerns. The result came gradually like fog was cleared away. Yet, I felt that there was still something to be done.One day I heard someone say, “I stayed up all night last night, but this morning I went out to exercise as usual.” These plain words hit me. Actually it was the way he said it that inspired me. He seemed to take ‘staying up all night’ as nothing. I thought to myself, “right, lack of sleep for one or two days is not a big deal!” It was then when I found the piece I missed. It was the worries about ‘not having good sleep,’ concerns about ‘feeling tired the whole day,’ and irritation of bad sleep itself. When the night came, these concerns came to my mind. It was like an everyday habit. So, I cleared the worries away. When the worries were gone, I was able to fall asleep fast.Another symptom I had was that it was really difficult to get back to sleep once I woke up in the middle of the night. Imagine that you are sleeping in the mountain where wild animals live. If you wake up at night, you are highly alert and can’t go back to sleep again. This is how I felt if I describe it.I learned about cortisol hormone, the so-called stress hormone. If you are under stress, the level of cortisol hormone rises. When your body is on high alert, such as in a ‘fight-or-flight situation’, cortisol shuts down the functions that get in the way and makes your body ready to respond in dangerous situations. So, when you are exposed to stressful situations constantly, your body stays in the high level of cortisol, which interrupts your sleep. You need to work on your stress first. I was carrying a lot of worries and stress, which kept me alert in the middle of the night. I examined my mind and found what made me anxious. During meditation, I was able to let go of them. Once my mind relaxed, so did my body. I fall asleep fast now, and I don't get anxious about bad sleep. I feel relaxed even when I wake up in the middle of the night and can go back to sleep right away. But, what I am grateful for the most is the fact that I know what to do if I have bad sleep. Finally I am free from the worries about bad sleep. In order to sleep better, you should reflect on your mind and pinpoint the reasons for your poor sleep. Causes lie inside your mind, so getting rid of it is the only way to solve the problems. A simple but clear message is conveyed in the video below."
"As a former insomniac whose profession now forces me to fight to make every precious hour of sleep count, here are some tips that have worked well for me:Consistency: Keep the time that you go to bed and wake up constant. This includes weekends--don't change these parameters by more than an hour total per day if at all possible.Time: Make whatever adjustments you need to sleep 7-8 hours/night.

This includes weekends--don't change these parameters by more than an hour total per day if at all possible.Time: Make whatever adjustments you need to sleep 7-8 hours/night. My insomniac experience allows me to say with complete confidence that sleep is one of the biggest (and most underrated) factors in health, performance, and happiness. Respect your need for sleep, and trust me, many other things will just fall in place.Sleep cycles: Monitor your sleep cycles, and try your best not to get up in the middle of one. For instance, I know that mine are ~90 min in length. If I sleep ~3 hours, I will actually be more alert than if I sleep 4, just because waking up in the middle of deep sleep throws me off and it takes several hours to get out of the funk.Exercise: 30 min/day in some form or fashion is amazing. Sleep status synergizes with energy levels, and exercise seems to help me remain constant.Food: I've found that small meals/snacks spread throughout the day avoids food comas and subsequent hijacking of usual sleep patterns. Most people eat way more in one sitting than their body needs--so learn to read your body's signals and realize when you're not actually hungry anymore.Comfort: Make sure your bed is comfortable, that your thermostat isn't set too low/high, that your pillow supports your head at the appropriate level for your sleeping position (back, side, etc), etc. This makes a huge difference.Practice: I'm serious. Good sleep patterns require effort just like anything else. Take your sleep seriously, and it will pay off in every aspect of your life!Hope that helps. :-) Disclaimer: This answer is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

I agree that struggling with sleep is a common thing for many people.First of all, please think about this. What makes you not sleep well? Usually, one of the main reasons that make people not to sleep is because of countless thoughts. There are tens of thousands of thoughts in the head. And these thoughts are mostly useless. We usually think of something that already happened in the past or something that will happen in the future. Here are some examples of our thoughts in general.Being anxious about what will happen to me""What if I fail with the project for tomorrow because of ~.""Regret what I've done in the past.""I shouldn't have acted like that at that moment.""The anxiety that arises from having a relationship.""Why she did to me at that moment?""And, here are my tips to sleep well. First of all, We need to know where those thoughts come from and how to deal with them. So far, we didn't know the right answers to these questions; that is why people suffer from insomnia, stress, and anxiety without a clear solution. Fortunately, I got clear answers(or I prefer to say enlightenment) through meditation.Where those thoughts come from?The answer I attained is that all thoughts are coming from the lived life that I accumulated.How to deal with it?I could be free from all thoughts by discarding those minds.When you discard your mind from lived life with the proper meditation method, you will get these results.You can be free from all the stress and lingering thoughts that keep bothering you.You can sleep well naturally because there are no boiling thoughts over your head.You can find inner peace and true happiness within.Etc.. there are still so many other benefitsYou will become free once you case off all the roots of the mind. I hope that you can also have a restful sleep and find happiness within. It works for everyone. 🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️ I will attach the short video link if you are interested in learning more about meditation. Thank you for reading. Good luck.🌈"

Sharing six tips to help you sleep well, he also speaks about the Shambhavi Mahamudra, which blurs the line between being asleep and awake.Sadhguru: Do you find that one day morning when you get up, without any reason you are just feeling ugly? If it is happening even two or three times a year, then you must do certain things before you go to bed. It is very important. You can unconsciously incubate a lot of either negative or positive things in sleep. You can incubate either pleasantness or unpleasantness in an uninterrupted way very effectively in sleep. You can also incubate it during the day, but there are so many interruptions that it does not happen very efficiently. But if you have a tendency to go to bed in a certain way and you wake up in the morning feeling really nasty for simply no reason, that means you are incubating bad eggs in the night very efficiently. This is not just about psychological disturbances; it can cause major physiological problems over a period of time. It is important that you eliminate these things from your life. So before you go to bed in the night, there are certain things that you need to take care of. Tip #1: Take a Shower Always shower before you go to bed. It will make a lot of difference. Maybe cold showers are difficult in cold weather, so take a lukewarm shower, but do not go for hot showers in the night. A cold shower will keep you alert. You will sleep twenty minutes or half an hour later, but you will sleep better because it will take away certain things. When you shower, it is not just the dirt on the skin that you are taking away. Have you noticed, if you are very tense and anxious, after taking a shower, you come out feeling almost like a burden has been taken away from you? It is not just about washing the skin. A whole lot of things happen when water flows over your body. Taking a shower is a very rudimentary bhuta shuddhi because over seventy percent of your body is actually water. If you run water over it, a certain purification happens which is beyond cleaning the skin. Tip #2: Don’t Sleep Right After a Meal If you are eating meat and other kinds of meals, it is best to eat at least three to four hours before you go to bed so that the digestion is over. Before going to bed, drink a certain amount of water; you will see that it gets taken care of. Tip #3: Light a Lamp One more thing you can do is just light an organic oil lamp. Use a cotton wick, do not use something else. You can use linseed oil, rice-bran oil, sesame oil, olive oil or any organic oil with a cotton wick. Just light one little lamp somewhere in the room where you sleep and you will see that these things will completely disappear. Tip #4: Remember That Time Is Running Out! Keep this in your mind that you are truly a mortal. Not just in words, really see that you could fall dead right now. I will bless you with a long life, but it is possible that you or me could fall dead right now. Please be conscious of this. This is not to create fear or paranoia but just to know the reality. If you know, ""I am truly mortal and my time is so limited,"" you will have no time to be angry, to quarrel with someone, or to do anything that does not really matter to you. If you are conscious of your mortality, you will do only what you truly care for in your life. Before you go to bed, sit on your bed with the thought that this is your deathbed and you have just one more minute to live. Just look back and see, what you have done today, is it worthwhile? Just do this one simple exercise. And when it really happens, who knows whether you will be sitting on your deathbed or lying in a hospital with all kinds of things sticking into you. So enjoy this every day that you sit on your deathbed, look back and see, ""Today, the way I have handled these twenty-four hours, is it worthwhile because now I am dying?"" If you do this, you will live a worthwhile life, believe me. Tip #5: Keep Things Aside Just do this before you go to bed. In the last three minutes, keep aside everything that you have gathered – the body, the content of the mind, and the small things. Do not ignore small things; these small things are big things. I have seen how people are carrying their own private pillow because it is very important. Your pillow, your footwear, if you have relationships, everything that you have gathered – keep it aside and sleep. If you manage to sleep like that, you will wake up with something else altogether different. You will wake up with much more light, energy and possibilities than you have imagined possible. Just sleep as life – not as a man or woman, not as this and that. Simply keep everything down. Tip #6: Do Not “Head North” If you put your head to the north and sleep during the night in a horizontal position, then slowly the blood will get pulled towards your brain. When there is too much circulation in the brain, you cannot sleep peacefully. If you have any kind of inherently weak aspects in your brain or if you are of old age, you could die in your sleep. One can have hemorrhage because extra blood is trying to enter the brain where the blood vessels are hairlike. Something extra is being pushed because of the magnetic pull of the planet. When you are in a vertical position, this is not so. The moment you become horizontal, this pull on the head is strong. This is true only in the northern hemisphere. If you go to Australia, you should not put your head to the south. If you are in India you should not put your head to the north. It is okay if you put it any other way. Question: I tend to have a lot of visions in my sleep. I was wondering if you could talk about that? Sadhguru: Once, a burglar was caught stealing and he was taken to the court. On the surface, this man was well-to-do, so the judge asked him, “You have enough in life. Why are you stealing from other people?” The burglar said, “Well, you know, the wise have always said, ‘Whatever a man may have, he always wants more.’” The judge looked at him and said, “Okay. I give you 10 years. If you want more, tell me.” At least in sleep, do not look for more. It would be fantastic if you did not look for more in wakefulness either – simply be. If that is not possible for you right now, at least in sleep, do not ask for more – simply sleep. You can make sleep into a phenomenally productive process so that you will need less sleep. If you sleep in absolute relaxation, the gene expression and other processes in the body will happen more quickly and more efficiently. That means you will wake up sooner. If you are inefficient in wakefulness, it is not good, but we will bear with you. But if you are inefficient even in sleep, death will be the only answer, because that is the only area where you cannot be inefficient. When you die, you die. If you learn to simply sleep, to “simply be” in wakefulness will be the next step. Sleep is a state where you are on the edge between the world of sounds and the world of silence, but you can only move into the world of silence when you are aware. You can move through the world of sounds and forms unaware, but you cannot move into the world of silence, which is devoid of any vibration, devoid of any forms, in unawareness. How to Improve Sleep Quality We want to use sleep as a platform for awakening, to become one with all that is real – not as a way to become inert, dead, and away from all that is real. Improving sleep quality does not mean sleeping like a stone. But actually, a stone is the wrong example, because in my experience, stones are very alive – a lot more alive than many human beings. “Sleeping like a log” would be a better expression, because a log is dead – it is not a tree anymore. This is not about sleeping like a log, but about sleeping in a live manner – being awake and asleep at the same time. If you bring even a small percentage of this element into your sleep, you will naturally become meditative over a period of time. Meditation, not as an act but as a quality, will become a part of your existence. Shambhavi Mahamudra We have tried to bring this aspect into people’s life in so many ways, starting with the Shambhavi Mahamudra. Shambhavi means twilight – you are between day and night, night and day. Twilight means you are asleep, but you are awake; you are awake, but you are asleep. Changing the quality of our sleep – not the quantum – is the necessary foundation for someone to become a Yogi. In wakefulness, you must be fully awake but if you check the parameters of the body, it must be asleep. In sleep, your body should sleep, your mind should sleep, but you must be awake. Sleep – Your Way to True Aliveness Aliveness is not an acquired state – it is your nature. “Just being” means being absolute life – not a mind, not a thought, not an emotion, not an ideology, not a philosophy, not a belief system, not a gender, not a race, not a caste, not a creed – just life. If you touch life on this level, you will know by experience that life and the source of life are packed inside each other. If you sit here just as a piece of life, there will be no separation between yourself and the Divine. If you cannot simply be yet, at least when you are asleep, simply sleep. It will do many miraculous things. If only you could be awake and asleep at once, you would be in the lap of the Divine for always.

This will help your body and mind get used to a consistent sleep rhythm.●	Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol in the evening. These substances can stimulate our nervous system and make it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep. They can also disrupt our sleep quality and cause we to wake up feeling groggy . ●	Create a comfortable and relaxing sleep environment. Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. We can use curtains, blinds, or shades to block out any external light. We can also use earplugs, fans, or white noise machines to reduce any noise that might disturb our sleep .●	Limit your exposure to blue light at night. Blue light is emitted by electronic devices such as smartphones, computers, and TVs. It can trick our brain into thinking that it is still daytime and suppress the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep cycle. To avoid this, We can wear glasses that block blue light, use apps that filter blue light from your screens, or turn off our devices at least an hour before bed. ●	Do some physical activity during the day. Exercise can improve our mood, energy, and health. It can also help us to sleep better at night by reducing stress and making you feel tired. However, avoid exercising too close to bedtime, as this can keep we awake with increased alertness and body temperature.●	Manage your stress and worries. Stress and anxiety can interfere with your sleep by making us feel restless, nervous, or overwhelmed. To cope with this, we can try some relaxation techniques before bed, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. We can also write down our thoughts or concerns in a journal and set them aside for the next day . I hope these tips will help us improve our sleep quality and duration. Sleep well! Thank you."

"I have had life long problems with sleep. Here is what I learnt1️⃣ Blackout Curtains. Thick curtains that block light and sound from the window. Think of the kind of curtains you see at good hotels. The kind of curtains that actually feel heavy and thick. Lots of curtains advertise blackout but are not. Go to a home improvement place that has curtain samples hanging. Then you can wrap a part of the curtain around your face and look up at the lights. If you can still see the lights from the store ceiling try the next one until you find one that blocks them. 2️⃣ A Hot Shower. Take a very hot showContinue ReadingI have had life long problems with sleep. Here is what I learnt1️⃣ Blackout Curtains. Thick curtains that block light and sound from the window. Think of the kind of curtains you see at good hotels. The kind of curtains that actually feel heavy and thick. Lots of curtains advertise blackout but are not. Go to a home improvement place that has curtain samples hanging. Then you can wrap a part of the curtain around your face and look up at the lights. If you can still see the lights from the store ceiling try the next one until you find one that blocks them. 2️⃣ A Hot Shower. Take a very hot shower moments before you lay down. As hot as you can stand. Use a massaging shower head and take the time to let the water pound out any cramps or pains. Dry off and immediately get into bed. It's okay to still be a tad wet when you hit the bed. If you wake up and can’t sleep take another hot shower! Take a daily over the counter pain killer (as / if recommended by your doctor) before you lay down. Even if you don’t have any pain now it will keep you from having pain later while asleep. 3️⃣ A Cold Room. Keep the room cold when you sleep. Even just on the side of uncomfortably cold. 67-70 is the ideal range according to sleep research studies. 4️⃣ A Warm Bed. Following up on the cold room... Get a very warm comfortable comforter or weighted blanket. This way you are not cold. 5️⃣ Watch The Caffeine! Avoid caffeine less than 12 hours from bedtime. The half life of caffeine is 5-6 hours. So if you drink 2 cups of coffee/soda 6 hours before bedtime, you have 1 cup still in you by the time you sleep! If you drank 4 cups you still have 2 in you! 6️⃣ Eat Early. Eat dinner at around 5-6 hours (or earlier) before you sleep then have a small snack when you get hungry before bed. When you eat a snack you want snack foods that will satiate you but be very small. Savory foods with a little fat and salt are the most satiating for hunger without filling you up too much. Packets of string cheese, crackers and pepperoni, cottage cheese on crackers with a dusting of seasoned salt, carrots and ranch dip, celery stick and peanut butter or cream cheese, cream cheese on half a bagel, a pudding cup, snack crackers and cheese or peanut butter, etc. Keep a glass of water on your nightstand so if you get thirsty you don’t have to get up out of bed. 7️⃣ Supplements? Melatonin can help but it seems to make me tired the next day rather than sleep better the night I take it. I dunno. Some people swear by supplements but I have had mixed results. They seem to affect everyone differently so experiment to see what works, or doesn’t. Also if the supplement says homeopathic don’t buy it. Homeopathy is not what you think it is.. 8️⃣ Pavlov’s Pillow. Buy some scented oils that you associate with calmness and rub a few drops into your pillowcases. For example lavender. This sets up a pavlovian response that will cause you to automatically associate the scent of lavender with your pillow and sleep. Now every time you lay down you will reinforce that. 9️⃣ White Noise. Use a fan in the room. Even if it is not pointed at you, leaving it on high will circulate the air and provide a white noise effect. 1️⃣0️⃣ Soft Music. I have set up a Spotify playlist of soft environmental music on my friends Spotify. I use this every night to sleep. Play it on shuffle very low so you can just barely hear the music. It has soft, pleasant sounds that should help give you good dreams. (I also have nightmares often and this helps avoid that.) Sleepy Snooze Nooze, a playlist on Spotify"

This is going to be aboutgetting a quality sleepmaking sure to fall asleep on timeassuring to regain a whole new energy levels every morningbecoming more alert and focused during wakefulnessovercoming the challenges of falling asleepIf you don’t want to get the science behind all these things, you can simply skim over the points in bold. If you want to save even more time and jump directly to the things to be followed, jump over to the ‘key takeaways’ at the end of this answer. Sleep is the only time where we are not conscious and all the biological systems in our body is shut down. This the time when those systems get their rest and repairs themselves. Also this is the time when we don’t use our sensory systems. Sleep is the one thing that very much determines how we stay during the wakeful period and vice versa. What we do in our wakeful period also determines on how better and fast we fall asleep. Sleep and wakefulness are complementary to each other and both are to be looked at to be better at both. What governs sleep? The chemical force - Adenosine Adenosine is a molecule that’s present in our body which is one among many factors that governs our sleep pattern. This molecule causes a sleep hunger within us. Higher levels of this molecule in the body will make us sleepy. If you rested well overnight with good quality sleep, the following morning, your adenosine levels will be low and from there on it steadily increases in the body. It causes that sleep hunger. Adenosine starts building up in higher rates as time passes in your wakeful state.Avoiding caffeine after 12 PM is better as it binds to the adenosine receptor and makes us feel more energetic which might mess up your ability to sleep better. Ayurveda doesn’t recommend coffee of it’s few ill effects. A better alternative can be Arjun tea which is also good for your heart. The internal clock - Circadian Rythm It is a 24 hour internal clock in our brain that also governs the times when we want to sleep or be awake. It regulates the cycles of sleepines and alertness in our body. This clock is totally controlled by light. Stressing the fact that light is the most important that decides our sleep patterns. It’s the sunlight especially. Sunlight is the tool that you can use to get better at sleep and alert during wakefulness. Going through the 24 hour clock - resolving the circadian rythm Most people tend to wake around sunrise or atmost, within 3 hours of sunrise. The adenosine levels are going to be low when you wake. It is at this time when the systems in the body create signals in the form of hormones. A pulse of cortisol is released from your adrenal glands when you wake up. A few amounts of adrenaline is also released which tend to alert the whole body and other systems to do it’s functions when we just wake up - like increased heart rate, blood pressure etc. Cortisol - a stress hormone The cortisol released early in the morning, as you wake is going to be helpful because that’s what makes you awake and alert. Cortisol is usually associated with stress. The more stressful life you lead more cortisol your adrenal glands release and this will have a really bad effects on your whole body in the long run and increase the risks of bumping into many health problems.As cortisol is released in morning as you wake, at this time, a timer in your body is set which dictates to your brain and body that in about 12–14 hours, another hormone called melatonin should be released from your pineal gland. Melatonin is the hormone that helps you fall asleep. Melatonin as supplement should be avoided except in extreme cases that too after consulting your doctor. Even if you take melatonin as supplement it is only going to help you fall asleep but not stay asleep and eventually you might wake within few hours of sleep.The most important thing that we should put to use are theseWe should aim to release cortisol (wake up) at an earlier time in your day, possibly along with the sunrise to reset the circadian rythm and help us fall asleep easy and better.The onset of this cortisol is what causes the release of melatonin at a later time in your day that makes you fall asleep. So timing the release of cortisol solves half the problemHow do we time the release As said we shall use the sunlight to time this cortisol-melatonin release properly. The sensory organ that helps us to get this sunlight into our brain is the eyes. The eye has connections to the brain neurons that convert this sunlight into electrical impulse and sends to the brain to a particular strucutre called as suprachiasmatic nucleus - the central clock.It is the central pacemaker of the circadian timing system and regulates most circadian rhythms in the body.The superchiasmatic nucleus is the structure that is connected to literally all parts of the body. Hence it regualtes the daily rythms of nearly all physiological and behavioral processes. We need to get the sunlight into our eyes at earlier time of day as the sun rises. It’s really better to get the sunlight into your eyes as close as to waking when the sun rises. This is the time when the quality of light optimal to time the cortisol release. Not any other light can prove to be optimal than the sunlight itself. Even if you later after sunrise you can simply go out and get the light energy into your eyesThe superchiamatic is sensitive to that particular quality of light from sun when it’s at low level near the horizon. Failing to get this quality of light into our eyes can really cause other health issues. Cortisol Melatonin rythm The below lines are a from research paper to determine the cortisol melatonin levels in shift workers. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775223/These two hormones regulate the 24-h pattern of the body function and response. Thus, in case the hormone-production cycle is disturbed by staying awake at night or sleeping during the day (as in shift working), it may lead to mood changes, dizziness, irritability, depression, and metabolic disorders, such as type II diabetes. The body's immune system may also be damaged, and consequently, the body will be more susceptible to the communicable, infectious diseasesLight colors and melatonin Melatonin is the sleep causing hormone that is released in response to darkness. Melatonin's sleep promoting actions are caused by it's feedback to the superchiamatic nucleus. Hence the reason to avoid light at night for falling asleep easily. Especially blue light wavelengths later in the day suppresses the release of melatonin. The longer we stay awake the more sensitive our retina becomes to light and even a little exposure to blue light can cause disturbances as time passes by. Also these rythms work by averaging out your exposure to bright lights in a day. So you would want to keep the lights dim near your sleep time and after sunset. Reduce your exposure to artificial lights from electronic devices. If in case there is no sunlight to trigger the central clock before sunrise we can use artificial blue lights as a means to set the clock but keep in mind that sunlight has the best quality of light to set these rythms. As you keep getting the right amount of light at the right time every morning the bio clock is going to shift itself earlier each day so it helps you wake earlier after 2-3 days of proper trigger of cortisol at the right time in the morning. Bad Effects of light Exposure to light after evening is definitely a bad thing that is totally going to mess up the whole rythm. Use blue filters for any devices that you use at night. What happens is that when you expose yourself to light after 11 PM in the night is that, the light from your devices get into your eyes and this signals a strucutre called habenula which blocks the dopamine system and shuts the down the whole reward system. It's more like an anti reward system. This can then have effects on your mood - getting disappointed, feeling low; lack of focus etc.Evening sunlight This is important as well. Getting few minutes of sunlight in the evening as the sun sets, when it’s near the horizon, is going to be really helpful in your sleep as well. This sunlight is what will help you from the harmful effects of artificial light that you might be exposed to, later that day. So simply put, viewing the sunligh late in the evening is going to be helpful for a better sleep. What keeps these rythms in place once they are in place These rythms are constantly responding to the external environment. So you will have follow these practices for life long to get good quality sleep. These are very simple practices that most of you follow it already except for getting the light at correct times. Once this internal clock is set, you will have to maintain it everyday and it depends on the many factors likeFood and nutritionTiming of food intakeAny medical and illegal drug consumptionExcerciseWhat you do in your wakeful timeGetting the right amount of sunlight everyday at right timesExposure to light after eveningLocation of light The retina in our eyes always creates an upside down visual image of what we see. It’s the brain that interprets the image and flips the image so that we are able to see it in the right side up.As a result of this, the lower part of retina is more sensitive to the overhead visual space and the upper part of the retina is more sensitive to the lower visual space. Coincidently, the neurons in the retina that respond to light that is directly connected to the central clock is predominantly placed in your lower part of retina, so that it can get much of the overhead sunlight to set these clock mechanisms in place. Hence, at night or late in the evening, it’s better to keep your devices at an angle lower to your eyes as this will have less effect on the neurons responsible for setting the central clock. Naps or sleep at other times of dayNaps are subjective to each individual. For some it is a kind of well rested situation but othere feel groggy. We will have to experiment it ourselves. But an alternative to naps or times when you feel like sleeping NSDR (non sleep deep rest) can help. NSDR has plenty of benefits than a nap and it's more like a guided meditation where you actually don't sleep but are just clearing your thoughts and making you feel relaxed and rested and energized.Google CEO Sundar Pichai says he uses NSDR, or 'non-sleep deep rest,' to unwind. Here's what it is and how it works.NSDR involves ""self-inducing a state of calm"" and ""directing our focus to something,"" typically through two practices, says Stanford's Andrew Huberman.https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-non-sleep-deep-rest-nsdr-relax-2022-3Key takeawaysGet your morning sunlight earlier in the day when the sun is at low solar levels as it rises.You can be out in the open space for 5-10 minutes, if the day is sunny.Even if you don’t find the sun, you can stay for longer durationYou need not gaze at the sun because there are a lot of photons floating around that's more than enough to set the circadian rythmLight viewed by our eyes is the only way to set the internal clock.Don’t expect to get this light through your windows or sunglasses or through windows as these are much less effective and really takes a lot of time to reap the benefits.The food you eat, duration of excercise, how often you excercise are other factors that determine sleep quality.Reduce the exposure to the light coming from these electronic devices (laptop, phones) late in the evening and turn on blue filter even if you had to work.Avoid any exposure to light strictly after 11 PM and reduce the levels of exposure after 8 PM.At night, it’s better to view these electronic devices at an angle lower to your eyes."
"I love doing breathing workouts just before I go to bed. They help release stress so much and improve sleep quality. I find mine in my Bellabeat app and I love them, but there are plenty of them online to try."
"Have a light dinner and take that before 7pm. Go for a brisk walk or engage in some physical activity. Discuss about how the day turned out with family to release any mental pressure. Read at least 2–3 pages of a book while on bed and you will have a sound sleep.

All the very best."
