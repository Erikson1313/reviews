"I've been literally been through a dozen sleep masks in search of the right balance of light blocking, comfortability on the eyes and nose, and a strap that doesn't annoy my ears or leave a mark. (For the record, I have a shaved head, so I'm likely more sensitive to the strap issues I've encountered)While I do wish this mask was a touch thicker and that I didn't feel any pressure on my eyes whatsoever, the fact is I've finally found the best overall balance of all necessities.Light blocking - checkComfortable strap - checkEasy on the face - checkNo nose interference - absolute checkThis feels like a soft linen gently hugging my face. The little pressure I can feel on my eyes is pleasant and not bothersome. The design makes the strap less of a strap and more of a ""wrap"" - if that makes sense… And because of this and the fact the mask hugs my face, I can sleep on my back AND my side without any discomfort whatsoever.It doesn't slide around if I move at night, which is one of the major issues I had with other masks. It just stays in place. Imagine a soft thin pillow over your eyes (and not on your nose at all) that literally shifts along with every movement you make. Absolutely no discomfort whatsoever.And yes, I'd love it if it was a touch thicker/fluffier, but this particular sacrifice is (A) totally a personal taste kinda thing and (B) likely what keeps it from being too warm. I've never particularly had an issue with sleep mask temperature being too warm, but this is the kind of design that could make for a warm mask… and warm it is not.The only thing I can't vouch for is the Velcro straps and how long they last before losing strength. I simply haven't had this mask long enough to objectively judge whether they continue to ""stick"" over time and multiples washes.I'll certainly update this review several months down the road, but after several nights of sleep, this is the winner out of everything I've tried.Absolutely stellar design and TOTALLY worth the wait for delivery (it took nearly 2 weeks)."
"I have bought almost a dozen sleep masks, trying to find one that blocks light while also being comfortable with multiple cartilage piercings. Most masks get caught or press on the ears, either due to the design or due to shifting during sleep. This mask does neither. It fits over a larger surface area than other masks (covering my entire ears, forehead, and temples), but is a soft jersey fabric that doesn't yank or irritate.It does soak up moisture quite easily, so I will be buying several pieces in order to start a washing rotation. People who sweat heavily or have an oily complexion may want to do the same."
"I sleep in a room with a ton of windows and its very bright. Unlike others, this sleep mask actually stays on y our head when you roll over on your side when asleep. It blocks out enough light to make it seem like you are in the dark. It fits comfortably over your nose and the strap in the back for a snug fit.My only 'con' with this mask is after washing it, I had to readjust the head strap but you can't even call it a con since there is velcro"
This is a game changer for me!  Since I've been using the mask I've had the most fulfilling sleep I've had in a while.  I'm actually mad that I didn't invest in this particular mask sooner.  Great product!
"I recently moved into an apartment with an east-facing bedroom, floor-to-ceiling windows and light filtering (at best) shades, and wasn't able to sleep once the sun came up.  It's a short term arrangement, and therefore I'm not considering replacing the shades or adding/altering window treatments, so I went on the hunt for a sleep mask.  I bought half a dozen masks, and this is, by far, my favorite.  It's not necessarily any more effective from a light-blocking standpoint, but is absolutely the most comfortable, and the only one I'll put on when I first go to bed, rather than waiting until morning to minimize the discomfort of the bands over my ears that the other masks cause.  I purchased a second for easy rotation and uninterrupted availability surrounding wash cycles."
"Soft quality item, with cooling- like effects. The fit is perfect if the strap other masks are designed with makes you uncomfortable."
Comfortable to wear and blocks all light. Doesn't get caught on hair. No chemical smell.
This mask is so comfortable. It can be rolled up so it's compact for traveling. It's lightweight enough for comfort but not too much that it falls off your face. Great price too! It feels like good quality and should last some years of frequent use.
This is the best sleep mask I've ever had. Very comfortable & blocks out all the light.
"I absolutely LOVE this! I work 3rd shift (11pm-7am) and have had EXTREME trouble finding a good eye mask that blocks out all light, while being comfortable. The ones I've found tighten via a strap, and the plastic part rubs up against my ear all night and hurts really bad when I wake up. But with this, so far I've had ZERO issues. Not only does it seem to block out 100% light, it fits on the nose well, and I've had NO issue with comfort. I'm extremely photo sensitive at night, so no light is a must. I actually slept all throughout the night these past few nights (any light that gets through my mask will eventually wake me up). Only downfall I could see happening is the velcro park eventually curling if you have to velcro it tight. I would honestly just buy a new one if that happened.Worth the price FOR SURE. It also comes with earplugs in a little case (which I lost already, otherwise I'd post a picture of them).All in all, worth the money, hands down. No light gets through, and super comfy (and I'm extremely sensitive, as I have sensory issues)"
Fabric nice. But was heavy on my eyes.
This didn't last very long. At first it worked great. After about a month the padding inside started to shift and you can see daylight through it. The mask would always seem to ride up while sleeping and it absorbed all the facial oils and made it look disgusting. The Velcro also didn't seem to hold very well. If you have an issue staying asleep when it is bright I would look at a different mask. Very disappointed in this one.
This mask will change the way your head lays on the pillow and will prop it up just a little bit. It annoys me and makes my neck hurt in the morning. It is too big.I don't like my ears against my head and it pushes your ears.  The fact that your entire face doesn't lay against the pillow and there's a slight bump can annoy you. Seems insignificant but it makes me not use this at all
"I have tried sleeping with this for a few weeks  now.Pros:Soft enough that I don't feel it after a while.The shape around the nose allows for very effective face covering, far superior to the standard eye mask shapeIt doesn't move around much on its own (tossing and turning is another story)Cons:The velcro strips make the entire back side very thick, meaning if you want to sleep on your back this is probably not feasible. It does not bother you if you sleep on your side. However in my case sleeping on my side causes problems (tossing/turning, loss of circulation) and my goal is to block the light so I can sleep on my back better without waking up.The cottony softness isn't quite as pleasant as a more silky texture would be, but I am not sensitive enough to care personally.If you toss and turn at all it can completely rotate around so that the nose hole is behind your head."
"This is a good face mask for short-term use. The outer layer of cotton is very thin and rips easily and the stitches come loose very easily to reveal a synthetic inner foam which separates easily into strands. This is NOT a durable product and starts getting flimsy after a couple of hand washes. It also stretches out, so the black straps after many uses don't meet each other at their original location. This mask doesn't last longer than a year, even if you hand stitch the separating pieces back together. For this price, I would expect much better quality, couple of rows of sturdy stitches, and 100% cotton, since polyester loses its qualities over time."
"Product boasts new design with this padded fold over the nose to block out light. Which works if you only sleep on your back. Side or stomach sleeping or generally shifting about at night moves the mask around. The padded part ends up on top of your eye,, applying pressure and generally being uncomfortable. If you tighten it to limit that issue, the way it wraps around your eyes applies pressure on the sides.The Velcro closer also doesn't hold very well after some uses.This would probably still be good on a plane for example, or taking a nap on a couch, but an all night bed sleep."
"This doesn't actually block light well. It's really comfortable. It stayed on pretty well compared to other masks that I've worn. However, I've never had any mask that lets so much light in. It definitely keeps things darker, and if the light is minimal it does a good job of blocking it all and not leaking. However, if you have full light such as a bedroom light on or bright sun in the window, you will get a face full of light. I wanted to love this, but it is not a good mask."
"Update!!Here it is just 4 months later and it's stretched out and the Velcro doesn't do what it's supposed to do! I'm so annoyed that I have to purchase a new one because this one didn't last at all! It's very unfortunate and I'm sad about it because it really did help me with sleep!Listen Black Out Curtians who!?! I get some of the best sleep I've ever gotten in a long time. I'm saddened to have learned they came with ear plugs because I didn't get them with my purchase, it's not a big deal but I bet my sleep would be better if I had them. I sleep through my phone calls when I wear this mask but not my alarms. I will be gifting my friends"
"Although it states it's 100% cotton material, it is hot and uncomfortable."
"I've tried many sleep masks over the years and was excited about this one. I felt confident that this was the sleep mask that was going to be a dream to sleep with.In the beginning, the velcro was aggressive to work with. Once it was on, it was really on! You can't slip it up either if you want to glance at something. It can also be very loud when you pull the velcro apart to take it off which did disturb my wife. Don't worry though, in about a month of nightly use, the velcro quality fades and then it has trouble staying on throughout the night.I bought this sleep mask a couple of months ago and now it slides around, falls off or I'll find it around my neck. OH, and it absorbs and retains the moisture from your face. You will see it in the sleep mask after a week or so. I will admit, it's very very soft and allows zero light in."
I use this for sleeping because I don't sleep! But this is not as comfortable as it looks! It hurts my ears.
"I was excited about the mask because it's much wider and covers your ears, and it is indeed soft. But, it isn't thick enough to keep light out in the morning (the whole point of a sleep mask), and the velcro is already losing strength a few weeks in. I would not buy it again - I'm going to have to replace it months sooner than other masks I've tried."
"Quality is pretty good except for the Velcro. it literally will not catch or grasp/lock the right side anymore, after only a couple of months of use."
"This product is a ""darkening"" mask. It does not black out and if the sun comes through the blinds it will not be blocked out.For someone who needs black out, it won't do the trick."
"I've used smaller sleep masks that have better seal against light infiltration. Tested this mask for several nights with different tightness. Although this mask is larger, it provides a worse seal against light than smaller ones, and even worse it presses against the eyes and can cover rmthe nose and be harder to breath."
"Soft and comfortable. You do not sweat but the material is thin. Light shines right through, not sure what the other reviews are about. It's like a sheet pressed on your face in regards to light coming right through. put the covers or a pillow in front and you're good. Update: velcro stops working in a month or two."
"Great at first, very cozy and soft. Started tearing at the seams after a month. Unfortunate. Would not recommend."
"I was excited about this eye mask based on the reviews. It was was very soft, however, the chemical smell in the material or from the warehouse was a deal breaker for me and did not abate even with time. It just stank and I couldn't stomach putting something like that on my face every night."
"Nicest sleep mask I have ever had!  However. The velcro is crap. Even if you pay for the upgraded velcro, it fails within a couple months. This is my second purchase and I will, unfortunately, not purchase again due to this."
Item doesn't work. Super soft and ComfortableBut doesn't work. Light comes in bottom.If you want a actual blackout. Gonna have to be the eye cup masks
I've used these masks for years and my family likes them as well.  I just purchased two more for friends I had gifted the masks to several years ago because they want to take them as a gift to relatives back East.  These really are helpful in getting a good night's sleep.
It's soft and covers both your eyes and ears. The ear plugs are an added bonus. Excellent if your spouse snores.
Comfortable and very soft
"This is the 3rd best thing in the world after Berry White and sliced bread. Sorry, nothing's better then Betty White and sliced bread.Migraine suffer here and this sleep mask allows me to recover quicker as it blocks 100% of the light, especially at the nose bridge. The few dollars upgrade for this model with the special fold at the nose bridge makes all the difference.I swear, I think it's made from angel shadows since it's SO SOFT!My migraines are also brought on by cold and the bonus with this type of mask are my ears are covered and don't get cold without ever getting hot.The material is not elastic and use Velcro to stay where you set them as tight or loose as you choose. The Velcro strips are long and do not loosen during the entire night. The straps are extremely comfortable and all well made.I have purchased many types in hopes of helping with the migraines so honestly had low expectations but I couldn't have been more wrong! I highly recommend these. They are better than I all I've purchased."
I work nights and sleep during the day. This mask is so soft and comfortable that I forget that I'm wearing it
Very good item
The size is perfect. It will fit from small to really large if you have thick hair. The material is extremely soft and I can't wait to use it on the plane!! I highly recommend this item!!👍
"I have bought two of these. I am very, very, picky. And as far as I am concerned, these are the best sleep masks ever made!!! Completely blocks the light. It Is so soft. As a side sleeper, it is important to be comfortable and still let no light in.I will buy again and agin."
"This is a great item, very soft, and full light blocking coverage for the eyes. So happy I found this item, I just ordered one for my husband."
I really like this sleeping mask. It is comfortable and works well for me.
No straps. Covers ears to dampen snoring noise.
I have had mine for two years and I love it. After washing it a few times the Velcro kinda wore out but it still works. I like how it covers my ears and there isn't a string because the string always hurts my ears and I can't be comfortable. This is by far the best night mask I have found and will be getting another one.
"I love this night mask! It is super soft on the face, does not get hot when wearing at night. Is adjustable and machine washable."
"Best sleeping mask I've used so far.I've used different versions of sleeping masks over the course of my life. This one is definitely my favorite. It's just so comfortable. Older masks I've used have been uncomfortable. Problems used to include readjusting the strap over/ontop my ears, the ""bump"" on the back where the two straps of velcro connects and becomes an annoying dense block, lack of breathability, itchy nose/ear area, sweaty eye cup areas... the list goes on. This mask, however, alleviates or eliminates all these issues. Yes it connects on the back, but it doesn't protrude to the point where it's uncomfortable. Light is sufficiently blocked and it just feels like my head is lightly being hugged. It's nice.The only potential con is using this mask during hot weather. It will absorb sweat and oil. None of these have been significant enough problems for me though. When I wash this, I keep the velcro attached together to prevent wear and tear and increase longevity.SO GLAD I found this product after a lifetime of using subpar eye masks from the drug store."
"UPDATE: After months of sleeping with this mask, I still love it. Two things though - the velcro has nearly stopped working and my face oils look gross on the mask after a few nights. I've bought a second one, hopefully the velcro issue will be better. I'm going to put new velcro on my old one, because I'm pretty sure I can't sleep without it. Also, having a second one will be good so I can clean them more often and not worry about not having my mask when I need it. I've been regularly washing (I use Goop to help with the face oils) and drying my mask with my regular laundry. The mask takes a really long time to dry, even in the dryer.Comfy. Cozy. Hygge. This mask is the mandatory uniform for blissful sleep. It hugs your head gently, rejecting light's agressive attempts to irritate and thwart sleep. Whilst wrapped, velcro neither yanks at my long luxurious locks nor nips at my soft sheets. Slumber is acquired in any position. Not too hot, and not too large, Goldie's Bears would most likely own this just right nighttime attire. A must for any Sleeping Beauty."
"This sleep mask is my favorite and I have quite a number of different styles and brands of sleep masks. This mask washes up beautifully and air drys quickly. The fabric is soft; wraps around my head and stays put overnight. My hair doesn't get caught in the velcro-like other masks either. While lying in bed, I face a window without blinds or curtains and, with the mask on, it's total darkness which also makes it convenient to use the mask for daytime naps.I've been working on my sleep hygiene habits and wearing a mask - based on the science that masks help your sleep quality - is part of it. As Jason Fried says, ""Sustained exhaustion is not a rite of passage. It's a mark of stupidity."" In addition to increased melatonin production, scientists have also linked dark sleeping conditions to increased time in REM sleep and decreased wakefulness—meaning you're more likely to sleep deeply and to sleep through the night. And they've found these benefits with sleep masks, not just in dark rooms. They're cheaper than blackout curtains. Just buy it - you will not regret it. Get your mask already to reprioritize sleep - it's not a luxury!"
"I guess the older you get, the thinner your eyelids become. I find it very difficult to sleep if there is ANY light whatsoever in a room. My bedroom at home is totally dark but when I travel, it's a different story. This sleep mask absolutely did the trick. It was the best one I have ever used. It is soft and comfortable and didn't hurt my ears. You won't be sorry you purchased this one."
"Great, now I am able to take naps during the day, and while traveling.Totally recommend it!"
"Nice product, I have tried several types of sleepmasks and this one is the most confortable I tried, very soft."
I look forward to using this sleep mask in the near future.
"I love the fact it covers your ears and is perfect around your nose. It blocks out light amazing while not being irritating to sleep in. The only issue that since its not bound to your ears like other covers, it often shifts around. I've often woken up in the morning with the nose piece off to the side. It's obvious that im moving around so it's bound to happen. But it's something to know about. Overall amazing product."
Very soft and mine came with ear plugs too.
Very soft. Fits securely. Cool and comfortable. Very glad I bought this.
"This face mask is a little steep on price but is very worth it. It's soft, comfortable, and darkens all light out. I even wear headphones underneath and it's still so comfortable. I hand wash and air dry it as others have said the dryer heat ruins the velcro and it has worked out well so far. Additionally, other reviews have talked about stretching and it might have a little but there's enough that it is still tight to my head. Once again, I highly recommend it."
"This sleep mask blocks out all light. It covers from the top of the forehead to just above the nostrils. It has two small wedges on each side of the nose to block out light. It is very soft, fairly breathable, and has some stretch to it."
"Blocks out light, easy to forget it's there."
Was a gift for a friend…loved it. So comfortable & was given awesome reviews. Would definitely recommend.
Put it on and don't feel any discomfort at all!! Stays cool at room temp and feels soft and cool to the touch. 10/10 great product!
"I bought this for my husband because our toddler's bed is in our room and he hasn't been sleeping due to monsters and needs as many nightlights on as possible. The light keeps my husband up so I was desperate to find a solution. When it arrived, I was really pleasantly surprised with the softness of the fabric. It feels really cozy. I was expecting my husband to take it off after a while but he slept like a baby with it on all night long. I think I'm going to buy one for myself. Highly recommend!"
This is absolutely the best sleep mask I have ever used. No annoying strap on the back of the head. It's extremely soft. Breathes very well. Keeps cool. Fantastic 👍
I hate the pressure from the strap on typical wraps so this was perfect for me! Added bonus of sound muffling and good coverage for minimal light intrusion. Super soft fabric
"This was my alternative instead of getting the black out curtains and everything to black out my room. I decided to go with this head wrap and it's really comfortable sits well over the bridge of my nose also has ear plugs pieces that I wear and it cancels out everything my eyes are well rested. It's machine washable, and I see no light when I wear it even if it's in a bright room."
"And I've bought a lot. I use every night, my wife watches TV late with headphones."
Great at blocking the light and staying put
"This sleep mask changed my sleep quality in a way I couldn't even believe - so comfy and soft too. My whole life I've had these sort of waking nightmares while falling asleep where I'll ""see"" some kind of creepy face or something in my room it wakes me up. (I think my eyes don't shut all the way when I sleep.) I'm also so sensitive to light that even with double blackout curtains the sun coming up wakes me without a sleep mask. I've bought tons of them over the years but I always take them off in my sleep or they slip off or the Velcro or buckle gives me a headache and I end up with a t-shirt on my face instead because that's somehow better. This is like having your head inside a comfy pillow - it blocks more light than any mask I've ever tried and bonus! It keeps out sound from your ears and keeps your head a little warm if you are a person like me who likes the feeling of the blankets pulled up over your head this is PERFECT. I swear it makes me feel like a baby wrapped in a blanket. It took me a night or two to figure out the exact tightness and position I like it in but my sleep got so much better. Sadly I lost it on vacation this week so I am buying another one RIGHT NOW! I have been sleeping horribly again ever since I lost the thing :( can't wait for new one!"
"I struggle to sleep during longer dayand this mask is perfect. It's a comfortable, adjustable mask that provides great light blockage, does not make me hot, and I am grateful!  The fabric is soft and oh so nice on my skin.  Looking forward to finally getting some sleep,"
"I work nights and my room gets very bright during the day, this has been a life saver. Super soft too!"
This sleep mask is so comfy and so efficient. The first night I used it I slept so soundly. Do be careful if you move in your sleep because it can slide off but for the most part the velcro helps it stay in place. I'm not one for writing reviews often but this product is worth it.
"LITERALLY THE BEST SLEEP MASK EVER!I've been using sleep masks for over 10 years (silk, cotton, adjustable straps, elastic, etc you name it—I had it!). After wearing this mask one night, I THREW ALL THE OTHERS AWAY! This is hands down the best sleep mask I've ever used and will ever use again (I'm seriously tempted to buy a second or third one to keep in my safe in case something happens to the one I have).I suffer from migraines so daytime snaps are common. I'm also EXTREMELY light sensitive.This mask blocks out ALL LIGHT. Seriously if you put your hand an inch from my face in broad daylight I could not see it.  The material is super comfortable, it's like the feeling of your favorite T-shirt. I love the width because if you are a tosser and turner like me, it won't slip or twist. The Velcro stays in place the entire night and lays flat—you can't feel it at all. I find it comforting that you can put it on tight or kind of loose. Very relaxing—almost like a weighted blanket. The material stays cool, it's breathable. There is some padding in there so it feels like a pillow whereas other masks can can feel like a tight ribbon across your eyes.I've machine washed it a few times with clothes or towels and it still feels like it just came out of the package.(It also came with ear plugs which was nice but I won't use them)YOU NEED THIS MASK. ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY AND MORE!"
"Sometimes I'll take a little nap in the afternoons to recharge my batteries. When I slip this mask on, it's cool and totally dark. There's no light reaching my pupils and within about 60 seconds, I'm sound asleep. Once my batts return to normal, I'm up and ready to rumble!!! (Brilliant idea.  Wish I'd thought of this)"
"I bought this mask and loved it so much that I bought two more, one for my husband and another for a friend. At first it feels amazing, very comfortable and a joy to wear. The material feels really good against your face. But this is not going to be an item that lasts a long time. Within a couple of weeks it no longer had that same comfortable feeling and some months later it doesn't even stay on bc it has very poorly designed velcro. Save your money for something better and more long-lasting."
I loved this sleep mask and thought I had found the perfect one until I washed it. Yes it does say hand wash on the tag but I wash my sleep masks regularly in the wash and dryer once a week to prevent acne. It's just not feasible to hand wash. I've had other sleep masks that have no issue being wash in the machine so I gave this one a try. It's ruined now. It shrunk a ton and the Velcro doesn't stick anymore. I'm very disappointed because it's not usable anymore. For the price I expected it to last more than a week. If it had held up in the wash I would give this sleep mask a 10+.
"I figured for $20 I would receive a solid product.  I have worn this mask about 10 times. Every time I wear it I wake up with really puffy eyes. Although I don't really know whats in or on the fabric, I react to it. I do not have sensitive skin. I do not recommend this product as I don't think they are being honest  about the materials and/ or chemicals being used. The actual construction of the eye mask is great but something is shady"
"I've had trouble sleeping since I was 13, I'm 35 at the time of writing this review. I have no doubts that it'll help some people out there. It didn't do much for me.Disclaimer, I also have sleep apnea and where a mask that goes over my head to my nose. It doesn't fit that well around it. Try and factor that in if you decide to buy it. Best I'm of luck if you do."
"This sleep mask is very comfortable, even keeps your head warm on colds nights. However I have only had it 6 months and it has already begun deteriorating. The fabric, while very soft, has begun to tear and frey in seemingly random spots."
"The Velcro no longer connects. When I tie it around my head, the Velcro does not connect so it ends up falling off immediately. I've owned it for two months and it is useless at this point.It's soft, and lightweight which is excellent but if the user can't connect it together then it's just a piece of cloth that has no purposeI expected this product to last much longer"
The nose on this was made poorly. The cut/sewing of the part tucked in is lopsided so one side is noticeably higher than the other. I have to look for an alternative product.
"This doesn't block out light completely unless your nose is probably large enough to cover the gap between the sleep mask and your nose. I didn't make it that tight but still felt pressure on my eyes because your eyes are literally directly touching the mask. Your eyelashes feel like they're being smooshed, which is what I dislike about the cheap eye masks and this is definitely not cheap. Some have claimed this blocks out noise because it wraps around your ears but the volume with and without this mask sound relatively similar. The only pro is that it's super soft."
I bought this to try to keep light outta my eyes and it does that BUT my head gets so hot mask comes off and I get the early morning sun in my face
"Overall i liked this sleep mask. It was comfortable and stayed on better throughout the night than most. Did not block out light 100% but was good enough. Would rate higher but the sleeping mask has begun ripping around the nose area. Far too expensive to rip after only 2 months of use, disappointing."
This provided better sleep quality but would have liked it to offer more darkness as the light still goes through.
"My mother ordered this for me, the over all fit is great, feels great love it, BUT the Velcro is terrible, after 6 weeks nit working, I have to add more if my own."
"Why did I wait so long to buy this. Amazing!!I'm a bald guy and I work on a  offshift this is amazing and it comes with ear plugsUpdate: was very much enjoying till velcro starting wearing out, not holding very frustrating!!"
"I returned mine. When I first tried it on, was so soft, felt like a cozy hug, but was very warm and so big that it outstretched past the top of my head."
"While this item is very soft and comfortable, the Velcro is of very poor quality - it barely stuck together new and now after a few washings and a few months, it doesn't fasten at all and any move,met during sleep resulting in the mask falling off."
The mask is super soft and comfortable.  My only issue is I don't like having pressure on my eyes.  Ended up giving it to a friend who loves it though.
"Pros:  the fabric is very comfy, the shape of the mask works, and it blocks light effectively.Cons:  way too large.  We had to hand sew ours so that they wouldn't fall down around our necks.  Not sure whose gigantic heads these are made for."
"I like the design, but this is NOT made of 100% cotton as advertised, it's a synthetic blend and synthetic fill.  It's fairly well sewn but after 2 months of use has stretched out and slips off.  I am using it but for the price expected it to be 100% cotton."
I don't exactly have a small head and this thing still felt kind of big. I would not try it.
The overlapping velcro straps in the back interferes with it being comfortable- if the back of your head is resting on a pillow. I like to change positions so not ideal for me. Otherwise nice and soft.
"Soft, big, able to black out at night but fail to cover light completely under the sunlight due to the thin material, so sensitive person still gets trouble sleeping in the morning.You have to tie really tight to keep it from falling off at night, so puff eyes users will get hurt.Binder lost its strength after a month.Kinda hot to get my whole head covered all nightGood for those disciplined sleepers who want to be quicker to get in sleep."
Super soft and lightweight. Great compared to count our masks that are hard for sleepers that move in the eye sockets.This is very comfortable to wear and hardly notice it's on until you open your eyes
"Love this eye mask. Super comfortable. Only issue is the ability to get it clean after many nights of use. Not supposed to put it in the washing machine, and a hand wash doesn't really get the job done. Will eventually have to throw out simply because it's too dirty to use. Other than that, I really like it, especially compared to the usual eye mask options I've used in the past."
"Can get warm and it moves around a lot compared to the fake silk wrap around one I used to have. I do not really recommend it compared to the same style one made of a more silky material. Also, not well defined area for the nose."
"I love this mask! It's soo soft and doesn't irritate at all. It blocks almost all light except for a small amount near the nose opening area (which is expected) & it also blocks out a small amount of sound. Only thing I don't love is the back Velcro part is kinda thick and I feel it because I sleep on my back. But it's still a great mask, probably one of the best."
"It's super soft and very comfortable when I'm sleeping on my side or stomach. If you're a back sleeper you might find the Velcro adjustment to be too thick. It is not complete blackout but I'll take that for the comfort, breathable and softness. I'd buy again, but I'd love to have one with a contour nose bridge (like a dust mask) to help seal the light out around your nose and cheek bones. Of the 3 eyemasks I've owned this is by far my favorite."
"UPDATED:  The company who makes this reached out to me because I originally rated this 1 star.  They sent me a new one that was bigger, stays on all night, and the velcro still works after several months.OLD:  Not good for people who move around in their sleep.  I would wake up and find the mask somewhere in my bed or on the floor.  Also, the velcro does not work after a month."
I think the product is good. It covers my ears and it covers my eyes.  I do feel that it doesn't help the sound to much  But I think it's a personal preference getting used to it.  Some nights I look forward to wearing it and others I just don't want anything on me  Also you don't want to adjust it after your partner goes to sleep because the Velcro obviously is noisy!
Great for side or stomach sleepers and will block out all the light. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you sleep on your back though since that's where the velcro straps come together so it's like your head is resting a big lump.
"It's super soft and pretty overall comfortable, I just wish there were extra space in the eye area"
"I love this mask and have multiple of them.  This is the first sleep mask I've seen that isn't bulky but totally covered your eyes AND ears.  The fabric is unbelievably soft and any adjustments in size are easy with the Velcro closure.My only issue is that since I'm very light sensitive, it's easy to oversleep!"
"I have been through… so many sleep masks over the years. This one is my new favorite.The main things I look for are:- Complete light blockage (no leakage from the nose / cheeks)- Sensory friendly- WashabilityWhat does this mask feel like? First of all, the material is great if you're like me and have to have cotton everything. It's incredibly soft, breathes a little, doesn't itch or scratch at the seams, and has a surprising amount of cushion to it. I didn't have an issue with the feel of the Velcro at the back, and the overall height of the panel allows it to disperse some of the tension across my forehead and cheeks, rather than my brows and eyes alone. Overall, it's ridiculously more comfortable than the traditional, shorter style of masks I've tried previously. However… this mask DOES touch my eyelashes. I was surprised to find that the sensation wasn't super uncomfortable or abrasive, as I have had issues in the past, but it's something to keep in mind if this is a dealbreaker for you. The material also completely covers my ears, but it doesn't provide any sound dampening if that's something you're looking for.In terms of light blockage, this mask mostly met my criteria! There's a small area of extra material around the nose that acts as a ""bridge"" of sorts to block any light from leaking through. Did this work perfectly? No. If I moved my head, the mask would occasionally slip and offer a little sliver of light through. HOWEVER, this was nowhere near as bad as the other masks I've tried, and I also wear my masks rather loosely due to sensory issues, which likely contributed. If you like your masks firm and/or tight, this might work better for you. For me, I just try to place it well and keep my head lifted when I need to roll around.Last but not least, washability. The instructions state to hand wash the mask… I'm not doing that LOL. I zipped it in a lingerie bag and threw it in the wash the moment it arrived. So far, it's held up perfectly. I'll update if that changes!Overall, 5/5. This is a great mask for sensory sensitive people, even if you look like you're wearing a blindfold on steroids! LOL As a bonus, the cotton material and ease of washability has kept my sensitive skin from breaking out!"
"This mask is great and super comfortable, and most importantly you can wear it while sleeping on your side or stomach with very little inconvenience. It's light and soft and doesn't put too much pressure on your face or eyes. In addition, this version is ""upgraded"" with more material around the nose area. Seems like a small thing, but it makes a huge difference in blocking out light effectively."
"I got these for my girlfriend and I to replace the basic ones with the tiny strap on the back and wow they are so much more comfortable! I used to wake up to the little strap digging behind my ears, but this eye mask is comfy all around!"
"I bought this and the manta pro (the most expensive on the market). And without caring about prices, I returned the manta pro because this mask stays in place when you move your head on your pillow.This isn't perfect. There may be a light gap at the nose. It let's light through if you test it outside in daytime.But it's so wide and soft that it stays secure even when tossing & turning, allows for adjustment to pull down to cover nose gaps (get the slightly more expensive version for semi-useful nose flaps) , and puts no pressure on the eyes. If I adjust the verco right you can slide it on and off without undoing it and it still stays secure"
Super soft and cozy. No complaints! Sleep like a baby with this.
These are very soft and block light better than probably any other sleep mask (other than a blindfold) that I've used. If you're shopping around for sleeping masks try this one first.
"I am very sensitive to light in the mornings, and even blackout curtains have not been enough to stop the light from disrupting my sleep. I work long hours and often don't get home until midnight, so, especially in the summer, when it starts getting light out around 5:30 am, this has become a major problem for my sleep. I have tried other eye masks, but they put pressure on my face and were uncomfortable. I bought this on a whim, and it has truly changed my life. It does a perfect job keeping out the light, and I barely notice that it is on my head. My only critique is that if I am lying on my side for a long time, it can put pressure on my ear and cause it to hurt a little when I wake up. This problem is easily solved by ensuring the strap is not over my ear, so I don't find it much of an issue overall."
This is the first mask that is actually cotton so I don't wake up sweating and actually blocks out all of the light.  I like that it's big enough and has extra fabric to fit around the bridge of your nose so that it is actually blocking out all of the light.  I discovered it from my son and now my sister is ordering one.  We love it!!
This sleep mask saved me on a trip. It's like wearing a soft hug around your face.
"This is perfect for me. Covers ears and eyes, very comfortable (another company has a silky one and I like the one much better as it stays in place), soft, blackout. I'm thrilled."
This is my favorite eye mask.
This is absolutely the BEST sleep mask I've ever had. I was a night shift worker for more than 10 years and all the sleep masks had uncomfortable straps up over the ears and light always leaked in around my nose. This mask is soft and padded with contouring around the nose. No painful straps. The material softly wraps around your head and velcros in the back. Total darkness. Incredible!
I've tried multiple sleeping masks over the years.  The blackout of the light that this mask provides is absolutely amazing! The material is really soft.  I am a side sleeper so the sleekness of this mask on the sides (and all around) really helps.
"I've tried about 10 different masks over the years, this one is the best.- It isn't bulky, so its easy to sleep with on your back on side.- Soft, with little pads for the top of your nose that prevent the mask from falling down- Oversized design blocks light excelently from the top and bottom- The Biggest problem I've had with other masks is the elastic used in the headband. This causes the mask to slip off my face when moving around at night. Since this had no elastic, you can cinch it around your head, and it won't move an inch.Generally I don't take the time to review the products I buy on amazon since they number in the hundreds over the years, but this product deserved a review."
"I ended up buying two, because if I lose one I won't be able to sleep. So soft and comfortable. It adds a gentle pressure to my eyes that helps me relax and fall asleep. And in the morning it keeps out any light so I don't wake up too early. Definitely recommend for people who are light sleepers."
"I've tried SO MANY different sleep masks over the years. I worked night shift for a long time and every time I saw a new one, I'd try it out only to be let down. I only tried this one because I needed one for a post-op hospital stay, and Amazon's generous returns policy.This was amazing! The problem I've always had with other masks is that I have a big head with long hair and a small nose. The mask has to put pressure somewhere in order for it to work and that's usually either my hair, or my nose. If it's my hair it will just slip and slide around and won't work. If it's my nose, I feel like I can't breathe so it doesn't work.This mask is so lightweight and evenly distributes the pressure between forehead and nose. I don't know if I could use it every night (I'm so sensitive to anything on my face) but it was very comfortable for my hospital stay, where I slept a lot during the day. I've used it a few times since then at home when my husband wanted to stay up reading and it's stayed wonderful. Husband used it as well and said it's the best one I've bought. I wouldn't usually bother writing a good review on a product with like 7k good reviews already, but this one deserved it!"
"I opened up the package to a beautifully soft, comfortable eye mask. At first, I thought it was going to be too big, I have a small head (I wear children's size ball caps.) However, it fit snuggly, and comfortably. I also thought it may be too bulky on the back and sides, but after my first night's sleep, I can say it wasn't. No light came though, and it dodnt slip at all. Usually other sleep masks slip throughout the night and I'm always adjusting it, but not this one! I'm pleased with this mask so far. We shall see how it holds up!"
"This mask is pretty comfortable and I feel like it doesn't weigh on my eyes too badly, mostly because it is adjustable and I can make it as tight or lose as I I want. It also doesn't get hot or uncomfortable when wearing."
"I use this mask every night, and I love it! It's super comfortable, light and pillowy. It doesn't hurt my head or give me a headache like other sleep masks, and I love how adjustable it is and how much light it blocks out. Highly recommend!"
"Not to get in the weeds, but modal cotton is made from beech trees, not cotton fiber. With that out of the way, on with the sleep mask review.I could feel how soft the mask is and know it was not cotton. I wanted to not like the mask for that reason alone. But white nights in Alaska with no black out curtains had me on the hunt for a mask that stayed on and kept all light out. Basically this sleep mask  is a hostage mask, a very soft form fitting hostage mask. It stays on as I move around in my sleep and fools me into believing it is still dark outside and the sun is not up yet. Some may find how it covers the ears a bit a blessing or a curse because it will muffle outside noise as well. The price was high but in retrospect well worth it. Oh, in closing the only place where modal cotton is mentioned is on the manufacturing tag sewn to the mask."
I have to have complete darkness to sleep and always use an eye mask when I travel. I've never  had an eye mask this comfortable- it truly is cozy and makes it easier to fall asleep. Highly recommended.
"I've used a few of these and this is the best one so far. Comfortable and blocks light. Good velcro clasp. I was concerned because I have a big nose, and it doesn't have a big nose cutout, but it works well."
"Have tried many eye masks and this is best combination of light blocking, softness, and without the elastic wearing out and becoming too loose."
"Covers your eyes softly and allows your eyes to stay closed.  Bought another that was sort of cupped and any noise, I opened my eyes in the mask....hard time going back to sleep.  This mask also softly covers your ears as opposed to a band or tie; with a velcro adjustable closure.  Love it."
It behaves as it should
"I purchased a couple of similar products, comfort is very important to me and this product was easily the most comfortable.The material is soft, pliable and silky, there are no metal bands or clips. The velcro in the back gives a great amount of flexibility to match your head size.  Would buy again."
I have used regular eye shades with an elastic band but find them uncomfortable. These are very comfortable with no pressure spots. They also keep your ears warm if you are sleeping in a cold room. Pair them with some good ear plugs and get ready for plenty of ZZZZ's
very comfortable highly recommend
"Honestly it's a bit overpriced for what it is, however, it's so comfy and soft, and let's no light in."
"Big fan of this mask as it doesn't bother my ears and feels super soft...would buy again and just might because my wife keeps stealing it, lol"
"This has turned out to be my favorite sleep mask and I think I have tried them on. It is very soft, stays on my face the whole night which is amazing. I am a restless side sleeper and this mask really works for me."
This is very soft but secure over the head and doesn't have discomfort on the side on the pillow when I sleep.  Well done
This is so soft I don't feel it on. I love how I can sleep on my side and it doesn't even feel like it's there. It totally blocks out the light! I'm getting one for my husband too.
Fantastic.  So comfortable
It is so soft you won't believe it. And the fabric is cool to the touch and does not make you all hot while wearing it. It's a life saver for late night and 3rd shift workers who need to sleep during the day. I keep one in my car (I drive a LOT) for taking quick naps on long trips.
"I've tried several sleep masks including the tempur-pedic mask (very uncomfortable) but they were all uncomfortable  and bothered me while trying to sleep.  This one is very soft, completely shuts out the light and is velcro adjustable to fit your head without any pressure points and I'm unaware I'm wearing a sleep mask.  I ordered a second mask.  I would like Freshme to make them in black."
"I first got this sleep mask, on recommendation from my sister, to help me sleep with an insane roommate who has a fear of the dark and slept with the light on. This product works wonders! It blocked out all of the light in the room and the earbuds that came with it helped to cover the noise of my roommates phone ringing all night. I would not have been able to sleep without this product! Now I use this sleep mask to help me fall asleep better and faster if I need the extra darkness"
So soft and comfortable and blocks out the light!
"This item is indeed soft and comfortable to sleep in.  It is so comfortable in fact, that I had to buy a second and a third. The second because my wife confiscated the first one and the third because I believe my cat has stolen the second one."
"This is one of the more comfortable and all around light-blocking masks I've tried. The soft cotton construction doesn't press on your face. If you sweat a lot though, it will soak. You'll need to wash it from time to time. I haven't had any of the staining or bleeding issues others have reported. The main reason I bought this one though, was besides the fact that it didn't have uncomfortable eye pillows, the 'newly redesigned Velcro' looked better than traditional Velcro masks that eventually wear out.Well, it is different - it's far worse and wore out to the point it would not stay on my face without 5-6 adjustments/night within the first month I had it. That stuff is useless. I'd rather have the classic stuff. My next one I will be looking at designs that don't feature Velcro at all. I'd buy another one IF it had a different fastening device on it."
"I tend to mostly sleep on my side and stomach and this sleep mask works well for that application. It does a good job blocking the light and is relatively comfortable. My main problem with this is that after just one year of use, the velcro no long works and now these are utterly useless.Would not purchase again."
"It blocks the light, very comfortable and soft but, after about three weeks the Velcro stopped sticking to itself so it's very hard to keep on during the night"
"So I thought I'd love this mask.  Ever since I started using sleep masks, this one has been hands down the best.  The problem is it didn't last as long as my previous masks.I love how big this mask is.  I have a very big head, so it's not easy finding things that fit around it.  This mask is one of those rare exceptions.  The material is also very cool and soft around my face.The problem is, even though it's most comfortable sleep mask I've ever used...it's also had the shortest lifespan.  I bought this at the end of May.  So I've been using it since June.  June-October.  Five months.  The velcro is already wearing out and not holding together anymore.  The past few nights now, I would put the mask on and it would immediately loosen, unfasten, and fall off; taking 2-3 attempts before I could get the velcro to stick."
"product material is pretty soft, the only problem is the odor, if you sweat while wearing it, it will absorb all your sweat and smells bad, I understand I can wash it, but i am afraid i cant wash it every single day after I use it"
Approximately five months and the Velcro has come off.  Can't seem to reach company and Amazon will not take back.  Just wanted an exchange.
"To be fair, many of the rooms set high expectations that I was about to revolutionize my sleep.  I'd say my sleep is slightly better, but not always noticing so.It is soft, and does well enough blocking out light. It stays on better than traditional masks.My concerns:- the velcro is positioned for a large head, so the soft end stops short, leaving an inch or so of the stiffer velcro flap, which is noticing when I sleep on that side. The soft end of the velcro should be repositioned so those with average or small heads can fully attach the stiff end.- surprisingly, it's come off a few times in the middle of the night. I'm not sure how, but it has.- the biggest issue is, because of the coverage, it can give you bad bed hair if it's not positioned well for those with shorter hair.Overall, I'm okay with it."
"I've been using the same mask every night for months now, and I'm at the point of having to purchase another one, only because it's basically falling off my head. The Velcro no longer works. The rough side of the Velcro sticks to everything EXCEPT for the soft side anymore. It falls off my face when I sleep now. And while it is comfortable, it stains just from the oils on your face. I also use over night eye drops to help my dry eye, and the mask easily picks up any stray tears, so the side I use over my eyes is dark and stained around where the forehead and eyes lay, even if I wash it. At this point I've had to wash it every week, and the stains from the simple oil of your skin do not come out either, even if it's clean, hand or machine wash. And my skin isn't even oily, so what's the catch. I'm buying another though, I guess I'll just have to get one every few months when the Velcro decides not to work anymore. Rip. Disappointed but it's okay. I can sacrifice I guess :/"
"I was hopeful when I ordered this mask, but when I opened the package, I was surprised to see how asymmetrical it was, with one side of the nose having much more padding than the other. I tried it for one night, and sure enough, light crept in on the right side of my nose. I am returning it for a replacement in the hopes that this one was just a lemon. If the replacement is not better, I'll just return it for good."
"I want to love this!! I had a similar one for a long time, but it needed to be replaced, so I tried this one based on the design and reviews.  but for me, it slips off my head every night, waking me up.  I have it as tight as it can go, which is very snug, so it is beyond me why it slips all the time. Have to find another option.It is so soft and when it is on, it does a great job with no letting light filter in, and even when it is tight, my eyes feel no pressure, so I really wish it would work for me!!"
I get migraines sometimes and need to lay down for a couple of hours to sleep it off. I usually have to put my head under the blanket to block out light. This sleep mask is game changer! So soft and comfortable!!
"My 4 out of 5 stars is due to the strap/size. The strap is way too long for my head and I have thick curly hair, and a thick skull! The excess material bothers me a bit when I move around and it sometimes folds back the other way behind my head (particularly while I read as I like to wear the mask around my forehead until I start to doze off). I would cut it but I'm afraid it will undo entirely and no, I will not sew shut the end because I'm not THAT disappointed...or motivated to alter a fairly pricey product. I have to wear the mask very snugly around my head to keep out the light, which means more excess strap at the end, which means a little annoying while turning in bed.The mask is not as stiff as I anticipated. In the images it almost looks like it is a foam material inside and it would stay shaped as such but it is a lot flimsier than that so it has changed shape after several months. The material directly over the eyes seems to have thinned out. It feels like batting inside that has been pulled apart.Overall, it is a decent product and certainly more comfortable than others I own as they are rigid cup shapes.I use this pair every night regardless of my minor issues so I'll keep them going until they no longer work.I do think the price is a little high for what you get."
"UPGRADED GREY REVIEWThis mask is the only mask that I've ever worn that effectively blocked out 100% of the outside light. It is indeed a upgrade over the old mask. However, there are new issues with this mask, mostly concerning wrapping of the mask around your head. The new mask is way too short and there is significant uncovered velcro. In order to cover all of the velcro, your head must be as wide as an outstretched hand. The old version never had this issue. The mask does seem to be thinner too but never really impacted me.__________________________________FIRST VERSION OLD REVIEWUPDATE 10/17/18:The seller of the product reached out about my issues with the mask and refunded me in full.  I'll suggest trying out this mask and contacting the seller if a problem occurs.  I feel like my nose shape may be an issue for me, however, most people will most likely not have this problem.In a attempt to solve my sleeping issues, I decided to go top dollar on this and did not like what I got.  Buy if you are willing to take the risk that the mask won't block all light no matter what you try.Pros:- Confortable- Doesn't get hot- Comes with a little caseCons- Doesn't block all light.  I say around 80% is blocked.  This could be a characteristic of my flat nose shape, however.  To compare, a $8 mask blocked at or a bit more light than this.- Not worth the $$$ (I would consider it to be much more worth if it actually worked as the materials of the mask is quite good.  Good sleep is priceless)"
"I have a small head so most head gears of any kind usually do not fit. This has incredibly long fastening strips so it could probably fot any head out there. The mask section is very large and covers my eyes,cheaks, forhead comfotably. It is padded enough that it doesnt press on my eyes or have gaps letting light irritate me or cause any air restrictions. The wide strap also lets me keep tight without discomfort or digging in. Also very easy to clean. I chuck it in with my shirts and it has held up great. The only draw back is that all of the features that make it so darn comfortable also put it a bit on the warm side but i believe when this one finally wares out i will replace it with the same product. Maybe try dif color but thats all id swap."
"Bought for my husband, he seems to be ok with itIt seems little heavy for me"
"I've tried a lot of masks and this is by far the highest I've ever rated one. It's extremely comfortable and easy to put on, even in the dark of night it's not hard to feel for the exact placement of the velcro in the back. The strap around the back of your head is the same width as the rest of the mask, so unlike the velcro+elastic straps on traditional masks, this won't stretch out and become unusable.It's easy to clean and incredibly soft, and for those of you with sensitive noses it had no weird bag smell, and even better, it doesn't PRESS on your nose like so many of them do.The nose area fits well, but sometimes it scoots a bit which allows light in near the nose area just slightly. This could easily be fixed by adding a short flap over those nose, in their design, that is the ONLY reason why I gave it 4 over 5 stars for sleep quality."
"It's a nice product, smell nice, very soft touch. The only thing is it has a velcro strip behid that can be a little unconfortable."
The wife uses this to block light when she really needs to get some sleep. She says it works but it's rather hot.
"It's surprisingly pretty comfortable. I am extremely particular about how I sleep, even a little disruption in comfort will keep me up all night. I was struggling to find a sleeping mask that didn't bother my ears (I'm a side sleeper). This one has been the best so far!The only real downfall I've encountered is because I have fairly oily skin on my face. This thing is like a super oil absorber, so I can really only wear it twice before it needs to be washed. And when I wash it, laundry detergent alone doesn't do the trick, so I have to use some Dawn dish soap with it.It says to hand wash it, but I throw it in the washing machine and dryer with normal loads all the time. It's held up pretty well so far."
"This is truly by far the best sleep mask ever! Fits comfortably, super soft, blocks ALL LIGHT, and you can adjust to your fitting even when it's snug it's still comfortable. I never read the reviews about the Velcro until mine began to decrease in efficiency so I came back to see if I missed something. After daily usage for about 3 months maybe a tad longer my Velcro has begun to deteriorate rather quickly. From working to not overnight. I would like for the Velcro to be a tad bit stronger however, I still recommend the product as I'll continue to purchase a new one as the time comes until something better comes along."
I sleep like a furnace.  I wanted this in place of getting blackout curtains for my east facing bedroom.  I was waking up at sunrise because of the extremely bright morning sunlight.  This didn't end up working for me.  Not only did it heat up my ears it also would end up slipping off my head somehow in the middle of the night.  It is by far the most comfortable sleeping mask I tried though.  It's incredibly soft compared to the others I tried.
I bought this sleep mask and I loved it. Unfortunately the quality isn't the greatest. The seam fell apart and the stuffing is falling out and the hook and loop fastener is worn out and no longer will hold the mask closed. I've had this less than a year and need to purchase something else.
"This does a great job of keeping the light out and is so soft. Unfortunately, it makes me sweat and sometimes leaves lines on my face when I sleep on my side."
"I have issues sleeping and need complete darkness in order to have a fighting chance at a good night's sleep. I purchased this for a flight to London and it was great. Yes, the material is very soft and feels great on my face and eyes. Yes, it does a great job of blocking out the light - very good. And it was convenient to have with the little bag especially while traveling. The issue came when I got back home and after about a month of using it, the Velcro stopped working, rendering it useless since it won't stay on my face! It appears to be very good quality Velcro so maybe I just got a lemon but it is a real bummer after it working so well that I can't continue to use it! It was on the expensive side so I was disappointed that it stopped working so quickly after purchasing it."
"It works, sort of. I was hoping it was thicker. Unless it is positioned just right light leeks in from the bottom."
"These are fabulous - super soft, totally darkening, like a warm cocoon for your eyeballs. But the Velcro wears out really fast. We have three of these - even our kid wanted one! And the Velcro stopped working on all of them in less than a year. Perhaps this is because we wash them, but um, you should wash them."
"I have been on a never ending quest to find the perfect sleep mask. Most of them hurt my ears with the Velcro straps, but I've purchased this particular sleep mask twice.Pros: extremely soft material, complete darkness when adjusted properlyCons: it doesn't really stay on through an entire night of sleep. I am not thrashing around my bed, most times I hardly move, but I find this always slips off or to the side. I do have to readjust upon waking. The other con - the Velcro wears out quickly, which is why I had to purchase this item again. It loses its toughness and then just stops sticking together."
"I never write reviews, but I needed to for this item.  This is the second one of these that I have bought in a fairly short amount of time.  The mask is so soft and comfortable.  This big issue is that the velcro just doesn't last.  It is so frustrating.  After a month or so, it gets less strong then it starts actually waking you up because you have to continually fix and attempt to re-attach it  Now I have two of these and neither of them work.  It is such a bummer because, until it stops working, it really is awesome."
The Velcro isn't really strong it won't latch in anymore even after being washed
"I bought this eye mask about 9 months ago. The material is super soft and comfortable. It does put a little pressure on the eyes but it is not uncomfortable; I actually like the gentle pressure for some reason (maybe because of a weighted blanket-like feeling on the eyes). My major complaint, and the reason for the 3 stars, is the lack of durability. Within 9 months the fabric had frayed and the Velcro has lost its stickiness, making this unusable. I expected more durability for the price tag. I bought a cheaper one ($13) that is just as comfortable. At least if that one becomes unusable in 9 months, I won't feel ripped off."
Velcro - after 1 wash does not work at all.
doesn't sleep well... falls off and is very bulky. but it is soft
I was really excited to open it- it is super soft. For some reason though- the velcro must be made for a giant to wear it on their head. I can't get it to stay on my head during the night because I have to make it tighter than what the velcro allows. Also- the fabric doesn't keep the light all the way out. I still have this one but most nights I resort to using my old one that is falling apart because it keeps the light out better and stays on my head.
"I loved this for the first couple of months I had it. Unfortunately, the Velcro gave out and it is completely unusable. I could replace it or add snaps, but not sure it is worth the effort. This is a design flaw that should have been resolved by the company."
"It works, but be aware that because there is so much fabric on your head, you'll swear like crazy. Ended up buying another mask that doesn't wrap around my entire head."
"I tried these at many different places on the velcro closure at the back. They are just way too much pressure on the face, especially on my eyes! I mean, your eyes DO NEED TO MOVE under your eyelids during sleep. Pretty much the worst eyeshades I've ever tried. The fabric is like padded t-shirt material, so it's soft, but if it isn't snug enough it just slides off your head.  And if it's snug, it will feel like your eyes are being pinned in place.  Grandma Blondie says, ""ICKY."""
"I thought I was going to really like these. They're a completely different design from the usual black mask with a little elastic band, and they cover your face from cheeks to forhead, and also cover your ears. The material is thick and soft. They come with a little stuff bag. All good.About half an hour after laying down with this on, my eyes started to bother me. The mask does press a bit on my eyes (depends on the shape of your face), so I figured that was it. About ten minutes later the skin on my cheeks and temples started to burn. Took off the mask.This says hand wash only, but I washed it before use in my fancy Bosch front loader on the ""handwash"" cycle, and dried it flat as per instructions, and there was only minimal distortion.  I am sensitive to a lot of finishes, so YMMV.  But I won't be wearing this again."
"This sleep mask is soft and comfortable, but it does not completely block out light.There is a gap on either side under the area that fits over the nose.That is tolerable, but unless you are a very still sleeper, the mask can twist around when you move your head on the pillow.Because of these two issues, the mask just didn't work for my husband or for me."
"This mask is huge.  Typically you want a sleep mask to be rather minimal.  I didn't like this mask at all.  It was bulky and made me sweat.  It didn't stay on my head at all.  While it was on, it did block the light well, so if you don't move around much in bed and don't mind the warmth it might be a good fit for you."
"First of all, you can get the same sleep mask for about ONE THIRD THE PRICE from another Amazon seller!  Keep looking!  And while is was fine during winter months, it COVERS TOO MUCH of the face to be comfortable during warmer months.  Could stand to lose an inch to an inch and a half from the upper portion.Good points are as follows:  It (and similar masks from other sellers at lesser cost) is softer than other sleep masks.  It (and similar masks from other sellers at lesser cost) is suitable for sidesleepers like me because it doesn't press uncomfortably on the side of the nose.To recap:  If this seller reduced his price down to that of at least one other Amazon seller (under 10 bucks), and lopped about an inch and a half from the upper portion, I would give this mask 5 stars, and recommend it highly, especially for sidesleepers."
"Extremely soft fabric that covers eyes well, blocks light completely and is very comfortable on the front. The strap at the back is a little thick and takes some getting used to because it props the head up a little if you use a firmer pillow. A thinner back strap would make this flawless."
"The mask in itself is fantastic, I had to replace the velcro with a better one a few weeks after getting it. Hope they make it better someday."
This might have worked but it was a bit bulky. I needed something a bit more sleek. Might be great for sidesleepers.
"No bloquea la luz si es muy fuerte, si lo vas a usar de día en un viaje, avión o automóvil. tomarlo en cuenta."
"The fabric isn't 100% lightproof...I'd say like 98%? Which is still great! I love that the fabric is cooling, and the straps don't hurt my ears. It is so comfortable, and I feel like I've gotten the best night's sleep from this. Sometimes I wake up because it seems to slide off in my sleep? But nevertheless, a game changer for me.The one star is deducted because of some light still leaking through and maybe the strap isn't strong enough to keep it from falling off my head...AND I wish I had gotten the ""Sysrion Sleep Eye Mask"" which can also be found here on Amazon, but at a cheaper price at seemingly similar value."
"I love how the product actually doesn't cause any ear pain from it being close to your ears, as well as how you barely feel it there when it is on. It does a great job at being very comfortable and works well. My biggest issue is the fact it moves side to side a bit too often. Also the velcro on the back will attach to fleece based items. Found out the hard way when I went to bed and it stuck to my pillow.If there was a way to cover the excess of the velcro I would give it a 5 star easy. Otherwise a strong 4 star."
"This is a good sleeping mask. It's comfortable, adjustable, and blocks light very well. I've already bought two and I'm about to buy a third.Some downsides to the mask:1) While it never gets hot, on warm days it is less comfortable. After all, it's wrapped around your face & will block any cooling you may want.2) Not machine washable. After a year of washing, the hooks&loops stop working.3) Doesn't always stay in place, this mask sometimes rides around my head so that my eyes don't line up with the mask's eye-things. Not a deal breaker because the whole mask is comfortable anyway."
Once opening the box you can see how soft it is! As soon as you open it you cant help but feel how soft and surprisingly cold it feels. Dont worry its a good cold especially during warm nights. first night i tried it i fell asleep in about 5 mins! havent fallen asleep like that since junior high it honestly has fixed not only my sleeping schedule for the better but has fixed my mood throughout the whole day. Naps are never gonna be the same lol oh and it came with a pair of ear plugs in a little soft baggy.
"It blocks out 90% of the light except around my nose. It's very soft, and doesn't make me overheat or want to pull it off in my sleep. It did get very gross very fast and the fabric on the back tore around the Velcro. I will likely buy again anyway."
Exposure to ringworm
"im not impressed......  it doesn't stay on at night,  it says it covers ears but it didn't work the way I wanted it too.  I won't buy again."
"This mask does not provide 100% blackout. So it's about as useful as tying a bandana over your eyes.It's soft, that's kinda nice."
"Great comfort, I would highly recommend if you do not sweat."
Like everyone said this mask works. Light is blocked. The mask is soft. Sleeping was easy. Now a month later the Velcro won't stick any more or barely sticks. No idea why. The mask won't work if it can't stay on your head.Really good when it works. Hope they get better Velcro in the future.
This mask started off well but the velcro failed after a couple of washes. Had to throw the mask away.
"Although when you first put this on it feel really comfortable, while sleeping it is very difficult to have this stay in place.  I don't know what the issue is.  Maybe because it is so freaking huge, but there is no head grip.  Every single night, at least 3-4 times, I wake up to find this laying somewhere else on the bed than where my head is found.  I would love to return this, but since it's something that has been worn, I will eat the loss, so that no one has to handle my skin cells.  I bought another sleep mask, but will keep this for travel.  I think it would work well for airline travel, but laying down with it is useless."
"I really liked this sleep mask. I would give 5 stars but after using it for about a week the product has began to fall apart at the seems. So poor quality, I guess. From the price point I thought it would not have had this issue. Guess I'll have to find another brand."
"It's super soft and comfortable, but doesn't do it's job! This is not blackout whatsoever, I can still see light through this eye mask. Completely defeats the purpose and I get terrible sleep with this. Plus I think this mask gives me acne (probably because I had to consistently tug it down during the night to keep it covering my eyes.)I actually had to revert to my old crappy eye mask that's hanging on by a thread because of how bad my sleep was with this one."
"I bought this thinking it will actually keep all the light out. The only thing is, this is a one size fits all kinda thing. So it kept sliding up and off my head. The velcro would kinda of stay attached, but it was uncomfortable to lay on. The material used was comfortable, but for normal to oily skin you can clearly see where your face was touching the mask. Like when you see the oil spot from that paper stuff at doctors offices."
"After unpacking the mask, I noticed a small red stain on it.  I'm not sure if it's a blood stain but it sure does look & feel like it.  Needless to say, I am grossed out and will be returning it ASAP.If not for the stain, I would have rated this mask four stars.  I did not try it on (for obvious reasons) but it is very soft.  However, I do not think it will block out light as well as masks I have used in the past."
This is not sound proof by any stretch. Iy comes with 2 little earbuds you can stick in your ears and then you can have some quiet. The material is soft and very floppy. It does stay on your head .. I guess it has that going for it.
The material is soft as advertised but the cloth presses against eyeballs causing uncomfortable to wear. If you have long eyelashes it's definitely an abysmal sleep mask.
As soon as I received this I realized it wasn't going to last - the velcro is really cheap/poor quality and barely holds it together. Shame because it's comfortable otherwise but I ended up going back to a sleep mask with a more traditional elastic band.
This mask gets really hot at night. It would be good for winter weather but no way I am able to use this in the summer. I would recommend changing the material this is made out of into some kind of cooling material.
"The mask is very soft and definitely blocks out light. However, the Velcro is not very strong, and the mask comes off when I turn my head during sleep. Then I wake up to fix the mask. Not very helpful for people who struggle to stay asleep, but it may work well if your issue is falling asleep. It may work well for sleeping on a plane, too, where you're more upright and turn your head less often."
I couldn't wear it because it's too big.  It covers too much of my face and it was too hot and the Velcro stuck my hair and I had to cut my hair out.  Unusable for me.
"I really loved this product at first and even bought another one as a gift. However, a couple of months later the velcro doesn't stick anymore. Really bummed b/c the mask was really comfortable, but now it's pretty much useless. I'm not sure if it's just poor quality or doesn't hold up well to machine washing."
"I do not like this sleep mask. It didn't stay on my head, I woke up with my dog playing with it on the floor. The material is very light and doesn't block out the light. I would not recommend to anybody. Save your money and buy something different."
"I am a side sleeper, but found that this mask would rotate around my head too easily, so I would wake up and have to adjust it. If you try to tighten it, it can feel like a vise around your head. It is very soft, but looks silly."
"Velcro didn't last long and wouldn't keep itself together for more then a month,  not a good option for sleepers who move even a little as it will come undone or off with very little movement."
Velcro strap is uncomfortable when lying on my back which is how I sleep 90% of the time.  It was more comforable on my side.  It does not block out all of the light.  The earplugs are useless.  It does contact your eyelashes so can not use it with extensions.  There is no nose piece like shown in some of the pics on other reviews.  I am returning
"If this mask was shaped to stand away from one's eyelashes, it might just be perfect. Ideally, the cutout for the nose would be slightly bigger (taller), too. This mask is very soft, the strap is very comfortable. I just didn't like it pressing against my eyelashes.I'm using the Alaska Bear sleep mask, but it's strap is uncomfortable because the slip ring and strap stitching, that makes the strap length adjustable, lines up with my left ear and that's not great for a side sleeper.I'd love to use this mask instead, but it needs some changes to work for me."
"Bought June 2020. This sleep mask started out great - no pressure on eyes, nice fit. My only complaint was that my ears are especially hard, so I had to wear it a bit loose so I didn't get ear pain, but that's not the product's fault.I was VERY relaxed with washing this. I washed it once every 1-2 months. Which is kind of gross considering how greasy faces are. Not even a year later, and the velcro is completely ineffective. It doesn't secure/stick anymore due to being washed, and the mask is constantly becoming undone, shifting, or coming off at night.So... It's a nice mask for travel or infrequent use, but if you need one every night then there are probably better masks without velcro. NodPods use a button to secure - I'm giving those a try next"
This is a great mask that is very soft unfortunately being state of Florida with the climate it just doesn't work because it creates more heat around your forehead with our climate I had to take it off even with my fans going
The midline seam for the nose is off center which causes the mask to sit slightly askew. It's not unusable and the fabric is very soft but it would be more comfortable if the seam was straight.
"I got this for an MRI lying on my back.  It would not work for that because there is an uncomfortable lump where the face mask overlaps with velcro right at the back of the head.  So, I used a random cheap mask they had available at the imaging center.  So, my plans were a fail.  I also can't use it for sleeping because I sleep on my back.  And I can't sleep with a bump right behind my head where the mask overlaps with the velcro.This was not designed well for lying on one's back.  But, it might be great for side sleepers or stomach sleepers or I guess if there is an MRI where you aren't lying on your back."
"I sleep with an eye mask every night and spent a long time looking for the one I wanted to buy to replace my current one. I was excited by the reviews for this one, but unfortunately it was very uncomfortable. If I put it on tightly enough that it wouldn't fall off in the night it gave me a headache, but if I made it looser it just slid right off. Also, even when I wore it loosely, my eyebrows were very irritated in the morning (like how your hair feels if you wear a ponytail all day). I should have returned it, but it didn't feel worth going through the trouble. I have put it in the ""giveaway"" basket and will try to rehome it soon."
"This was exactly what I was looking for - soft, pillowy, blocked out all light and softened sounds. Unfortunately 6 months later the Velcro won't stick together despite attempts to refresh it"
"I consider myself a connoisseur of sleep masks. I've had this one on my wishlist and when I lost my eye mask during travel, I though this would be a perfect purchase. I was really hoping to like this one as it was very comfortable and soft but after a couple weeks of usage, I've given up.The pros are that it's very comfortable and soft. It keeps out a decent amount of light (not totally black out but then again I've never found one that is, light can still get in the nose area, especially when you're laying down). The biggest con is that, because of the size, this thing moves around SO much. I've woken up and had it completely twisted on my head several times throughout the night. Also, it's difficult to tighten it without a lot of overlap on the velcro.Alas, my search for the perfect sleep mask continues."
"It's hard to find a mask that doesn't press on my eyeballs, is good for side sleepers, and blocks out the light. This checks off 2 of those boxes, but doesn't block out the light under my nose. I didn't want to return it and wait for a different one to come in, so I hacked it to make it suit my needs. I cut up the small satchel it came with and sewed blinders on the bottom of this mask. Now it's a great mask that checks all boxes. I hope the manufacturers see this review and consider changing the design to implement these simple blinders, because, what's the point of a sleep mask if it doesn't block out the light? Aside from the light issue, the mask is super comfortable and soft, and really does work well for side sleepers."
"If this was advertised as a sleep mask, I would give 5 stars.Since it was advertised as a BLACKOUT sleep mask, I give it 3 stars.It's soft, comfortable, intelligent use of the velcro, and stays on while sleeping. It does not need an 'eye cup' since it is very comfortable with your eyes and lashes.BUT, if you are looking for a blackout mask, be aware that this is, at best, is a 'grey-out' mask.For all the reasons blackout is advised, I cannot say that this mask is recommended."
"It's been a month or two and I already have to wrap this almost beyond the limits of the velcro to get it to stay. Even when I first bought it it began to come off in the middle of the night, prompting me to wake up once the sun started to rise- which, in Maine, is as early as 4:30 am in the winter. If you're willing to put in some extra effort and attach more velcro to it, which you can buy in any craft store, you can get it tight enough to stay on. Because beyond that problem, it does do a pretty good job of blocking out light and being comfortable, so it's certainly not the worst product out there. I'd recommend it over those sleep masks that have wimpy little elastic straps."
"Like most cotton products, this is treated with chemicals to keep moths away (or something like that). It has a chemical smell right out of the box. It was fine once I washed it though.Unlike my previous favorite mask, the Sleepmaster, this mask is not too thick to wear in warm weather. It also has a new type of velcro that looks like it won't rip up the surrounding fabric. (This is a big issue with the Sleepmaster).Under bright light, I can see some light through it. This will probably only matter to people who are extremely light-sensitive. I think the manufacturer should make the inside layer out of black cloth (or maybe make an all black version of the mask)."
"If you live in a cold-weather climate this is a great item to have when you sleep at night, but during the warmer summer months, if your room doesn't have AC, you will find your head boiling because the fabric will trap yourheat. It works as intended, but it feels uncomfortable when it is warm."
"Does not completely block out light from the TV or bright daylight.  It is, however, very comfortable and does help better than nothing"
"I really like this product - comfy and easy, but after 2 years the velcro no longer works at all and the cushioning/material has thinned so it no longer blocks as much light. Wish it would have had more longevity - so five stars to start with, but -2 for not being a longer-term investment (I hate waste so I try to purchase things that are maybe a little more money up front but with the hope they will last). I've always babied it by washing in a delicates bag and hang drying."
"Softest, most comfortable sleep mask I have ever worn. The Velcro wears out after a month or two of nightly use though and it no longer stays on."
"I don't know if there is something strange about my eyebrows, but this thing really hurts them!  I have tried loosening it, but that doesn't help. Nothing else has ever made my eyebrows hurt, and I can't even tell why it's happening! Other than that, this sleep mask is perfect."
"I want to love this eye mask and give it 5 stars but even after buying a few of them the velcro strip has proven to be such a let down. The ""stickiness"" of the velcro decreases pretty quickly over time (within a couple weeks!) and I constantly have to re-velcro the strap around my head over and over. It comes loose when I'm sleeping and/or slips up over my head. That's the only reason why I'm giving the product 3 stars. Otherwise it's super soft and does a great job blocking light. I'm currently looking for a competitive product but based on the product photos of competitors it looks like everybody is using this same velcro manufacturer."
"At first I thought this was the best sleep mask I ever owned. After a couple washes it doesn't stay in place, the velcro in the back doesn't stay fastened, and the mask rolls up exposing eyes to light"
"I mean, I guess it works. It's no more comfortable or effective than tying an old tee shirt around your head, which is something I've done, and it's certainly less cost effective, but it's something around your head and over your eyes to block out light. Of course, it'll change position while you sleep, and stop working, so there's that. It also sometimes causes me to wake up with a headache from the pressure, too."
"The bulky velcro strap makes it difficult to wear comfortably which makes it borderline useless, especially if you are a back sleeper. I can feel it digging into the back of my head when I lay on my back. It would be a good product otherwise."
"This was the best sleep mask that I've ever worn and I slept very well while wearing it.  Unfortunately, after one month of normal usage the velcro started failing and it would come off anytime I moved.  About 10 days after that the velcro was useless and I could no longer stick the straps together.  I can't recommend a product that only lasts for a month, but If that design flaw could be fixed it would be a great product."
"It's meh. I find that is doesn't block out light 100%. It isn't fitted well enough in the nose to do that, but if you're desperate enough, it'll do a good enough job I suppose. Not only do I find it sliding off on the night, if you can get your velcro to stick, it will press down on tour eyelashes."
"I would have loved it the very first time I put it on. The very first thing I noticed is it is very soft and very comfortable. And then there's the bulky velcro tape in the back of your head. During the course of my sleep, I woke up and found that it has already turned around my head, the velcro is already over my left ear"
I have the V2 mask with the wider Velcro strap. Unfortunately and quite strangely the Velcro has lost most of its grip so the mask doesn't stay snug and tends to come undone while sleeping. Otherwise it would be great
"It's a comfortable mask that is nice and wide but I found that it constantly sliding off my face or coming apart in the middle of the night because of the narrow Velcro fasteners.  Maybe it's because I sleep on my side?  Feels like the mask would be best used for those who sleep on their backs or for traveling.Edited - Lowered it down to 2 stars.  The thin, Velcro fasteners no longer work, making the mask practically useless."
"I absolutely loved this product at first. It is very soft and does a true blackout job. But after a few months of maybe twice/week use, the stitching is coming undone in the nose area and the velcro doesn't hold well, even with a toothbrush cleaning. The velco just seems a little too smooth for something you really want to hold onto your face as you toss and turn. Loved it but wished it lasted longer for the price."
"I have been using this eye mask for about a month now and have some issues with it. The height of it is unnecessarily high and the cut-in for your nose is not deep enough. Because of this, the mask rides up my head through the night, causing me to keep readjusting it through the night. If I don't, light seeps in through the bottom. It would be so much better if it was about 2"" shorter, with a deeper notch for your nose."
"Had high hopes for this but over time, like within months , the velcro at back stopped securing. They need to upgrade the fastening velcro and make the material softer and washable. Not durable.  Replacing mine and looking elsewhere"
"The only part I didn't like about this mask is where the velcro joins at it is fairly uncomfortable if you're a back sleeper (which I am part of the night).  As such, I usually only use this mask as the light starts creeping in the window."
"overall its a solid product, blocks out nearly all light, comfortable, and soft. downside is the velcro combined with side sleeping. if you sleep on one side and depending on your head size, the velco will be between your head and the pillow. if you have a firmer pillow, the material will compress and that velcro will be felt directly on the side of your head and lightly stab you. its not really bad, but pretty uncomfortable on my perferred sleeping side and was irritating enough to keep me from being able to fall asleep."
Super soft. Does look really funny though.
"The material is very soft and comfortable. Bonus: I don't feel like a horror villain while wearing this. Pretty enough to leave lying out when not in use.In the proper position, it's quite good at blocking out all light. It tends to shift on my head during sleep, so by the morning some light seeps in. However, it stays in place until I fall asleep, so it does the job when I need it most.The velcro in the back makes it easier to adjust the fit than a typical strap-sliding eye mask. When it is tight enough not to fall off it is comfortable around my head, but does put pressure on my eyes and eyelashes. My eyes are slightly sore when I wake up. Because of this, I can't give it 5 *s, but I do prefer it to eye masks."
"I switched from a standard sleep mask.  This one is SO SOFT and comfy, but it tends to ride up throughout the night.  It's also a bit thin so light seeps through if the room is bright.  Since it's not shaped around the eye, you can also get light through the nose/cheeks area.  The velcro isn't very soft and I can feel it when I lie on my back, but it's not terrible.  It goes over your ears but don't think that blocks out any sound - it's just more comfortable than a thin strap that goes over your ears.I know that doesn't sound like a positive review, but I'm just telling you what might be disappointing.  All in all I find it comfortable and effective for blocking out light in a mostly dark room."
"Extremely pleasant, soft cotton material. This is the first time I have had a wrap a sleep mask around my eyes like this. It was bit odd at first but you get used to it after a while. A big pro is that it fits comfortably on people with larger heads like me!"
"It's good, not great, for sleep.  I paid around $20 for it and now have found similar or better sleep masks for around or less than the price I paid for this model.  I have slept in it, it is soft, and the band is comfortable, my main complaint is that it can sit at an awkward angle on the bridge of the nose (the nasal slit doesn't seem big enough to account for the mask moving a little downwards or upwards during sleep).  I am unsure I'd buy this sleep mask model again, maybe for half of what I paid for it, but it suits its purpose this Winter."
I love how big it is.  It covers half your face so you know it's not going to ride up while you sleep.  But all that fabric is stifling if it's not ice cold in your bedroom.  Just something to consider.  The quality was great and well stitched and made of very soft cotton that felt luxurious.
"I'll defer my full review until the cooler fall and winter evenings arrive. I wore this on a warm July evening, and I felt like I was wearing a coassack hat. Way too much warm material....i started to sweat.The material however is very soft and zero light enters. So i'd say if you live in a cool climate, look no further. But this is a large mask, with a lot of material, so it may not be suitable for those enduring already hot summer nights."
"I've had this sleep mask for less than a year. I love the size, softness and blackout quality the best.After a few machine washing's though the Velcro began to wear out,  very  disappointing."
"Update January 13, 2023: after a few more months with this mask I have decided to update my review with some additional thoughts. Everything new will be designated with the * character. However, my initial rating of 3 stars will not change.I have had issues falling and staying asleep for my entire adult life, and I've tried a dozen different sleep masks. I've been using this sleep mask for six months now, and while I enjoy it enough to keep using it for the time being, I have some issues with it. That is to say, if I find something better, I will not hesitate to leave this one behind.Pros:1. The material is very soft and comfortable. I never had a problem with scratching or chafing anywhere. This is the most comfortable eye mask I've ever worn. * I've tried silk masks that are genuinely less comfortable than this one.2. No elastic band keeping the mask in place means nothing cutting or digging into your ears. * The light pressure of the mask wrapping around the ears might be really nice for some people - I definitely like it.3. Velcro strap is adjustable for heads of all sizes. * The velcro is also pretty wide so it's easy to line up and has worked well (lots of sticking) the entire time I've had the mask.* 4. The nose wing is narrower than I've seen on other masks, which means that it does block out a lot of light that might otherwise get in through the bottom.Cons:1. The mask does not provide a true blackout. Bright enough light (any kind of sunlight, including pre-dawn and post-dusk) will still get through the materials and into your eyes. With your eyes closed this effect is noticeable depending on the amount of ambient light, and some people may find this to be a major detractor.2. The Velcro strips are not placed well on the fabric. What I mean is that with the mask fitted tightly, the velcro strips will only overlap about 10-15%. If you overlap the strips perfectly, the mask would almost certainly not fit anyone. I don't have a really small head or anything so all the wasted velcro real estate strikes me as a design flaw. This has a side effect of leaving a long tail on the mask of unused velcro area that flops around.3. Slipping off overnight. I will still often wake up in the middle of the night and have to grope around in the dark for my mask, which has come off due to my tossing and turning. My restless sleeping is clearly a personal problem to begin with but the fact is the mask rarely stays on my head overnight.* 4. The lack of a black color option strikes me as a mistake. Being colored black might indeed help the mask to block out more light than the gray color.Notes:1. You have to wash this thing at least once a week or more to keep it clean. It absorbs face/skin/hair oil like mad and stains quite easily.2. The material will stretch over time with repeated use. This has certainly contributed to some of the problems I outlined above, but longevity of a product is a valid parameter to consider in a product. If you have a small head, you might have to buy a new mask within six months. * I have had to buy a new mask at this point because of the aforementioned reason. The velcro strips simply do not align anymore for me to wear the old mask at all tightly. I can wear it loosely but then it just slips right off.* 3. The mask does not offer any kind of noise reduction or anything. This is not advertised as one of the features so this wouldn't count as a con in my book.I give it 3/5 for being very comfortable and having a good idea for a design despite that design being flawed and the material not providing a total blackout as I had hoped."
"For the first week, it worked wonderfully. It was larger than I liked reaching from my nose bridge to my hair line. It DID block out light 100%, it was SUPER comfortable, not really catching too much hair in the velcro. And didn't break me out. Once my face oil's started staining it, I handwashed it. The velcro wasn't as good after but still worked. My husband sent it through the wash the second time and completely destroyed the velcro. There is no way to tie it to keep using it so it is trashed. Overall I would say middle range."
"This mask stays on and doesn't let light through the cracks like others. It's also soft. The problem is that so much light comes through the material, I wake up from it anyway. It's only suitable if you are already in a somewhat dark room. Don't expect it to help when you are traveling and trying to block out daylight."
"I've had this mask for about a month now.  At first, I thought I had finally found the holy grail of sleep masks - it fit snugly with plenty of room left on the velcro, it stayed in place throughout the night despite frequent tossing and turning, the wrap around style covering the ears blocked all the light and muffled any sounds, and the fabric was soft and comfortable to wear.  Sadly, after a full month of regular use, only that last point still holds true.  I'm someone that is easily bothered by the smallest bit of light, so using a sleep mask on a nightly basis is essential for me.  I also move around a lot in my sleep, so it's very important that any sleep mask I use have the ability to withstand that and stay in place all night long.  While this one fit snugly and stayed in place at first, after the first couple of weeks it started to stretch out.  Now that it has been about a full month of use, it has stretched out to the point where I'm running out of velcro space to be able to fasten it as tightly as I need to, and I frequently wake up to find it around my forehead, on my pillow, or somewhere else in the bed entirely.  The fabric also stains HORRIBLY from ANY amount of sweat or oils from your skin, and once it stains it's impossible to get out.  I've washed it several times various different ways trying to get the stain out, but it still looks absolutely disgusting, as if I wore it as a sweatband to work out in outside in 100 degree heat for a week straight and never bothered to clean it.  I've attached a picture to show how bad it looks now despite having been washed more than once in an attempt to remove the stain.  After the very first night of trying this, I had very high hopes that I had finally found the perfect sleep mask that fits all my needs.  Sadly, that hope was short lived and my search continues."
"I wear sleep masks fairly often, and have I owned various models over the years. (I live in a city apartment where the light from the street finds its way through both blinds and curtains.)At first I loved this sleep mask, which I ordered in ""upgraded gray"". It's very comfortable and well-designed; there's just the right amount of padding below one's eyes to keep out light, and to leave space so that my eyelashes don't brush in a distracting way against the inside of the mask. The same cannot be said of other designs I've tried.Here's the problem. After the first wearing, and more so after the second, the fabric became badly soiled by what I took to be normal facial oil. I'm an adult, and have normal - not oily - skin. I don't use a moisturizer.The stain is unsightly, and would not come out!. I washed the mask several times, used a laundry stain pre-wash spray, and soaked the mask overnight in a strong solution of oxygen bleach. and nothing I tried made it better. It looks dirty.I liked the mask so much that I bought a second one, thinking that perhaps I had used some odd soap or other product on my skin before bed. For the second mask I was careful to wash with a hypoallergenic,""99.8%"" pure soap. The same stain appeared, and nothing after multiple attempts made it better.I've never had an issue like this with any cloth that has ever touched my skin, including fabrics of model and silk. I'm not a squeamish person, and I don't automatically recoil from objects which look soiled. I still use the mask sometimes, hoping that I may think of a new cleaning idea.Fortunately, after I put it on, my eyes are closed."
"I was hoping to get a super breathable mask but this one was so hot that I had to take it off every night I wore it (a week). It definitely blocks out the light but if you sleep hot, I wouldn't recommend itUpdate - While I still stand behind my review, I have updated the rating to reflect the customer service of the company as they did reach out to see what they could do to make this a better overall experience."
"I wanted this to be the perfect eye mask. I like the fit over the ears, and it blocks the light well, it's just not breathable enough and maybe has too much coverage to be comfortable. I'm not even a hot sleeper and woke up sweating both nights I tried it."
"I've used this mask for about 1.5 years and love it!I've been using sleep masks for years and this is by far the best. My favorite part is having no band sitting on top of your ears. The over-the-ear design of this mask keeps my ears from hurting in the night.Great for side sleepers.One downside - it's slowly stretched out over the years. Right now I can barely attach the velcro because it's so stretched. I'm going to purchase another because I liked it so much, but not ideal to keep purchasing every 1-2 years.Update:2nd one I bought was horrible. 2 months in and the  velcro barely sticks. Huge bummer"
"I do LOVE this.  It is SOFT, the velrco is a different kind and doesn't get all mussed and stuck in your hair.  I wear mine a little lose as I do like to watch TV as I fall asleep so I start wearing it sort of like a headband and as I fade into sleep I tug it down.  If you pull it tight, yes it will block all light.  Loose it lets some peak in, enuf to peek out at the TV etc.  The back does have a noticeable lump, but you get used to that pretty fast if you have a soft pillow.  They could have thinned that out a bit.  I HAVE machine washed/air dried mine twice with no ill effects. (Cuz yucky eye gunk is a health hazard when left to build up).  I like that it also covers my ears-it doesnt mute sound but it does dull it a bit, just enough.  Some complain its too large, if you are small-headed and small build (small adult/child size) you might find it too large, otherwise its adjustable enough to fit all heads well with generous room for adjustment/tightness or looseness.  I bought mine based on reviews, LOVE IT, want another as a back up!  The carry case is sort of dumb, just a little piece of cloth that you will never use for this but a nice touch.  Still, FOR WHAT IT IS-price is about 10 bucks too much.  There is profit and then there is take you to the cleaners.  This is take you to the cleaners priced.  But don't let that stop you if you like SOFT and DARK. It is super soft!  *EDIT*  I did suffer some MAJOR headaches after using it at first-and I had it lose too, so, perhaps some off fuming?*Update 3/13/19*  Headaches went away after another SOAK and then washing, can I blame THIS MASK on headaches..well most likely given the timing of them.  But now FINE and I still love it! (whispers-but the price is too high for what it is! A pinch of foam, a pinch of some soft material, and the most expensive part, a couple of inches of that non stick to your hair vecro!  Cost of materials even at US prices-about $3.50)"
"Do you like the feeling of a plastic bag covering your entire head? Do you fantasize about waterboarding? Or do you like small, weak hands to be pulling a sheet over your face? Maybe you'll enjoy this ""mask."" It's really just a big, thick piece of fabric you wrap around your head. It doesn't block out all the light, though it will cover your ears. Just a strange and not well-designed accessory, though I will say it is soft."
"Very comfortable, I was worried it might be hit with some much coverage, but it stays cool and does a great job blocking light."
"This mask has ALMOST all components for me to be top of the line. It's soft, and fitted to your standards with the Velcro strap. However, the Velcro strap does not last. Mine won't fasten any longer without pulling it so tight it's uncomfortable. FIX the Velcro and it will be perfect!"
"The mask is super comfortable: soft fabric, really thin but still blocking the light.However, it is way too large for a normal adult head. It's 31 inches long (vs. 27 as advertised) and it makes a big difference (always fell off after a few minutes). Would be a 5-star if it was not for that problem.UPDATE: The company reached out to me saying they had a problem with the supplier. They sent a new version of the product and it is PERFECT !"
"Eye mask is pretty nice, it is very soft at first, and after a few weeks it is still mostly soft - but it does not seem it will last that much longer.It does cover the eyes quite well and goes over the ears and around the head and feels good. So if using ear plugs remember to add those first before putting on the eye mask"
This sleep mask is pretty comfortable. The fabric is very soft and it is much more comfortable over the ears since it doesn't have that exposed plastic elastic strap that other masks do. My only issue with the mask is that there is no support for the fabric over the eyes. So I have to wear it a little loose as to not annoy my eyes while I sleep.
"There is some light leakage through the material, not around the edges. Very comfortable though"
"I purchased this because I have a lot of windows and sometimes I like to sleep in.  This thing works perfect! It's comfy and blocks 99% of the light. I'm a 6'2"" 49YO male and it fits great. Someone on hear said it doesn't block sound lol. It's not supposed to! The description says you will sleep soundly meaning it will do it's job of blocking the light so you can sleep. Great product!"
"It is really soft and all, but the nose part is a bit uncomfortable for me."
"The mask's band wraps completely around your head comfortably, it blocks out all light, and even provides some noise reduction too. I like it especially, in comparison to traditional sleep masks, because it doesn't have a thin elastic band - those types usually fall off during the night with movement. I deducted one star for craftsmanship because the stitching came undone above the nose."
"As a side sleeper this is my favorite mask yet, but it is too hot for the summer months."
"I bought this to help sleep while camping in the summer in Iceland.  It worked like a charm.  The mask is quite comfortable and soft and it stays in place even when I roll around in the middle of the night.  There was a very small amount of light leakage down near my cheeks, but pulling the mask down farther mostly solved the issue."
Really soft and well crafted. The Velcro's section is even a bit reinforced which will definitely add to the life of it. It's large enough to fit around my head and my thick hair while comfortably covering my ears as well. Excellent buy!
My wife loves it.
"Very comfortable and soft, but does not muffle any sound. Great sleep mask however."
"I love this mask. The only downfall is if you wash it, it's done... It gets loose and Velcro is toasted. Writing review as I logged on to buy another one. I've washed mine 3x and now it won't stay on.... I cannot, not wash something wrapped around my face nightly at least every other week."
"It's soft and comfortable to wear, unfortunately the material doesn't block 100% of the light. It works for light coming from electronics in a dark room, but if you need it for blocking light in a well light room get something else."
It's great and comfortable to sleep in but I do notice some light coming in near my nose. It's manufacturered for a low bridge or an Asian fit. I would've liked for the nose area to be cut different for different nose shapes.
"Solid product. It's very comfortable.My only complaint is that the Velcro wears out quickly. I've had 3 in 18 months, yet I keep ordering them."
"Very soft and comfortable, covers most of your face too, which I was looking for. I had to adjust a bit to breathe out of my nose, and also it doesn't block 100% of light, maybe only 90%-95%, but still good enough to sleep in broad daylight."
"The thick velcro is a game changer with this product. I am a long-time used of the ""sleep-whale"" eye mask, however, I have gone through 3 in a year because they got so torn up with the small velcro strap. This product is great quality and very comfortable."
Pros: The mask is very soft. The adjustable strap makes it easy to fit to your head sizer. Fairly decent at keeping out light. Would be nicer for a side sleeper since it doesn't bulge when you turn to the sideCons: It does not breath & my face was hot! It covers your ears which adds to the heat. The size is odd as it seemed to be trying to block out the light for my forehead rather than my eyes.I ultimately returned as I couldn't stand wearing it for more than 5 minutes. My face was just too hot. Note I normally run cold so being that hot was not usual.
"Very soft, good light blockage, but...it hugs my head and completely destroys any hairdo. I have gone back to using my previous light blocker—a Covid mask worn over my eyes. Because it attaches to the ears it doesn't smash the hair."
"This mask was soft, comfy, and easily adjustable. Does a great job anchoring on the nose. The problem is that it's way too thin to the point where it doesn't block light well enough. Not super bright like closing your eyes and looking at the sun/lamp, but enough where I've been roused awake. Mainly good for rooms that will stay dark manually or have no light coming in from windows."
Its very comfortable but it gets warm so the room had to be cold for me to use it well
"My room is pretty chilly at night, and I am pretty col while sleeping, but even so - I had to rip this thing off my head after a few hours because my entire face had gotten so warm.It is very soft, yes, but it is like draping a very soft cotton towel around your head. Good luck using this thing in the summer!"
"This was just ok for me. It was my first sleep mask and I came to appreciate it. There were three issues I found: it slipped up my face at night. It became discolored where it was on my face from might moisturizers, even with washing every 4-7 days. And it smashed my lashes, causing them to grow in too curled. Like that's possible. But it was too much for me and my mascara rubbing off on my eyelids in the day! Had to move on to a new mask with a curved cup over the eye, which has been great. I used this for about 4 months."
"While this did eliminate light I was always having to adjust it, particularly around my noseEventually I gave up and took it offIt was also very warm"
It's so hot! I got these in preparation for a getaway in Iceland during the summer when it's light out late. I tried it a few times before the trip. It got too hot for me to sleep with it. Plus the band wraps around back and that's a bit uncomfortable to sleep on as well. I tried on the flight over and couldn't stand it. I ended up just using the free eye cover you get on the flight over. It was cooler and worked well enough for me. The one thing I liked was the softness and how much light it cuts out.
"Owned this for about 9 mo and 2 mo ago the velcro function stopped sticking together, so the mask falls off while sleeping, not sure if its because I washed it but otherwise worked well for the 1st 6 mo just don't hand wash/line dry! Hence the 3 star review, not good if you want it to last."
"I loved this facemask as it was soft and gentle, but the Velcro stopped working after a year. I liked it enough to order another, but still…"
"In my search for the perfect sleep mask, this is the best I found so far. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because it is too warm, although I might be grateful for that come winter, and because it takes so long to dry after washing. This mask does an excellent job of blocking out the light and not shifting around when I sleep.  I move a lot when sleeping,  and most masks shift too much, exposing my eyes. This mask is large enough that even if it does shift slightly, my eyes remain covered. In addition,  it doesn't leave marks on my face, which many masks do because they need to be tightened to keep them in place. And, what's very important to me, there's no metal or plastic to cut into my face or ears when shifting around when sleeping.  I wash it by hand once a week, but it takes a long time to dry. I started putting it in the dryer with my other laundry towards the end if the drying cycle, and that has helped."
"Really love the wrap around style of this sleep mask and the material is soft and comfortable. Does its job blocking out light. Only complaint is that the fabric stretches very easily.After a couple of nights use, the fabric starts to stretch out and does so progressively with each use. Because the mask is fastened by velcro, the stretching means that you have to fasten it further and tighter each night to the point where i'm running out of clearance with the velcro and i have 3 - 4 inches of the wrap just dangling.To mitigate this, im hand washing it once a week in hot water to try and shrink it back down. The cleaning and care instructions say not to tumble dry though, so you can only shrink it so much air drying it.Either way, i've used it every night since I've bought it and would miss it if I didn't have it."
It works well and comfortable.
"I bought this as a present for my son, so I really don't know first hand, however he tells me it is exactly what he wanted."
The velcro is super heavy duty. Overall the mask is very well made. The ear plugs that came with it are a nice little bonus. Only thing i would change would be to add extra padding around the nose to block out 100% of the light. But definatly still a great purchase
Very soft and comfortable not hot at all.
"HEY POTATO HEADS!!!This is it this is the one.  It's not perfect but it's almost perfectThe not-so-good first, the velcro enclosure could be a little bit tighter.  also it gets flimsy with age these aren't designed to last forever about 3 months.  But considering one to two months is as good as I've ever add sleep masks last this is doing better than they are.About the good witch makes it worth buying:. It is very soft it fits large heads it might actually be too large for smaller or average heads but the velcro in back is very long so it's got a huge range of adjustability so I would imagine anywhere from big up old potato heads like me all the way down to little girls.The fabric is extremely soft it does slightly put pressure on your eyelids but it's easy to get used to it can be kind of stretchy and they are not kidding when they say you must hand wash this and lay it out to dry don't even put it in the dryer on cool wash it on cool laying out to dry even still it's going to start to fall apart but you'll get a good three or four months out of it at leastWhat I can do is it sits just above my nose and it goes all the way up to almost passed my forehead and then from side-to-side it covers my ears it covers my forehead it completely covers my ears and it attaches to the velcro in back kind of low not up on the back of my head but low on the back of my head you can get it as tight or as loose as you want.it doesn't really stretch the fabric stretches out over time but it is not stretch fabric so you may feel a little claustrophobic if you have a tendency to thatAll in all it's not been any sort of problem for me it completely blacks out any light and with disposable ear plugs in my ears I never hear anything nor see any light peeking throughall in all it's very comfortable especially for guys who have great big potato heads this is the one you should be getting if hats don't fit you or any of the other stuff doesn't fit you.Recommended and I will be buying from them from now on out. I have been extremely pleased"
"This mask is very comfortable to wear especially if you sleep on your stomach or side, the wide band removes any pressure points that smaller straps tend to put on your ears. I move a lot during my sleep and it mostly stays in place over night, occasionally riding up a bit higher or turning around on my head. My biggest issue with it is how much it has stretched over the short time I've had it. When I got it the Velcro bands matched up perfectly, now about a month later I have to have it tightened so that 3-4"" stick out as an extra flap which occasionally catches on my sheets and pillow. Other than the stretching its one of the better sleep masks I've used."
I've bought two of these because I love them so much but I don't think I'll buy again.  It stretches out and becomes uncomfortable to wear. New it fit perfectly and I didn't even get to the end of the Velcro. Now there's 4-6 cm of slack past the end of the Velcro that are uncomfortable to sleep on doubled up like that.
"This is a different type of eye mask compared to your typical nylon band ones. This is very secure, but does go all the way around your head, and covers your ears too. A little different sensation, but not bad. I will update this after more use, but so far so good."
This sleep mask is exactly what I was looking for. I like my ears to be covered when I am falling asleep and sometimes it's too warm to pull the sheet/blanket all the way up. I love how soft this mask is and I love how large it is. There is some sort of light padding inside the two layers of cotton. The velcro is easy to adjust. It does tend to slide up and off my head in the middle of the night but I don't mind because I just use it to help me fall asleep quickly. My only complaint is that it must be hand washed. Unfortunately my night time face creams have rubbed off onto the mask and hand washing isn't sufficient in getting it off. I am going to have to machine wash it and hope it comes through ok!
"This mask is great!!!  My wife snores, and I've taken to wearing earplugs at night, but they usually fall out during the night.  I bought this mask because it covers the ears, and I was hoping it would help keep the plugs in.  Not only does it work to maintain the plugs in my ears, it's another layer of sound dampening.  The blocking out light is an added benefit, of course!  It's very comfortable and reasonably priced-- I couldn't recommend it more.  EDIT TO ADD:  After using this awhike I subtracted a star but probably should have done two.  The velco is poorly placed for a normal sized head making it close too large for my head... and I have a big head. Maybe it would work for a woman with lots of hair?!?  I ended up sewing it permanently closed at a proper fit size (less than the velco would allow) and still like it, but I shouldn't have needed to modify it."
I love this. It's super comfortable and I washed and dried it in the washer with clothes which I don't think is recommended but it's been fine. Only drawback is the color... I have oily skin and often use a retinol face oil before bed and the fabric darkens because of this. I know I can't be the only one with this issue. I saw another review wishing it coming in black and I second this suggestion so that the dark Gray doesn't discolor. Otherwise.. it's comfortable and keeps it dark enough for me at night.
"Most comfortable of many sleep masks I tested.Material very soft.Nose area, mostly stops light coming in. Probably better for people with flatter noses.Back strap is too thick if you are sleeping on your back, so it digs into back of head. Not very comfortable whixh is kinda the opposite of helping you sleep."
Could be better
"Comfortable and works well. Ear plugs that come with it are not great, but in terms of blocking out light, this does a great job."
The sleep mask was soft but it covers from top of forehead to tip of nose. The Velcro closing is strong but a little bulky if you sleep on the back of your head. Not a bad product just not as comfortable as I prefer.
"This eye mask, is such a simple concept. It's not complicated and isn't fancy.However, the main thing is that it works.I've had a few eye masks before, as I was having issues sleeping. I tend to be able to sleep in any condition, but sometimes when I'm pressed for sleep, I need something to block out everything.It doesn't really block any sound out, so it's not good for that. However, it is very good at blocking light and vision. You're able to adjust easier than most eye masks as it is velcro based and can just be unfastened, then re fastened (unlike others that are loosen or tighten).And since it's 100% cotton, it is soft and very comfortable. I tend to wear my headset and then the eye mask over it to get the complete sound and light block.For the price, I think this is pretty good investment and I recommend it. Only time will tell in terms of durability."
"Seriously this thing is amazing, and it's the only mask I've had that doesn't hurt my eyes to wear.Only problem is the Velcro in the back. It's way too strong for it's relatively weak stitching, and after a few wash cycles the stitching has almost completely come undone. I'm going to have to stitch it back on properly, or get a new one, and I've only had it maybe two months"
"Okay so this thing is amazingly soft, blocks out all light, and is pretty great. I'm glad I purchased it and it really helps when the sun comes thru my skylights at 6am. HOWEVER, the most absolutely infuriating and annoying thing is- the velco BARELY works. It will noooot stay velcroed. I have to redo it and press it down super hard like 4 times before it will stay, otherwise it will just completely detach. Overall, i love it, but pleeease fix the velcro thing. It seems small until i'm having to fix it every five minutes when all I want to do is go back to sleep."
"The Velcro stopped working after a few months so I could only lay the mask across my face, which didn't work at shielding my eyes from the light. Definitely not worth it for the price. You would think for how much this cost they would have used a higher quality Velcro…"
"It's okay.. but if you're trying to sleep during the daytime, this isn't that helpful. It does work fairly well at night, but it wasn't that comfortable to me and found myself not wearing it after a couple weeks of receiving it in the mail. I'd pass on this one. It's not necessarily bad, but it's not that great either. And I do think it's overpriced for just a strip of cloth over your face. This is be a $9.99 product honestly. At best that's how much this thing is worth."
Mask was way too big on the head and still let light in at the nose holes.
I like the size but it heats up to quick very sweaty
"Unless you've got a head the size of a watermelon, you'll have a hard time getting it to stay in place. I've got a normal, adult man sized head, and this thing barely stays on. There's not enough Velcro on the back, so I only get an inch or two to secure it. It blocks light, but that's about it. All in all, better than nothing, but I'd get something else."
"First, the positives: The mask is VERY comfortable. It's by far the most comfortable sleep mask I've tried. Incredibly soft, fits well on the face, it primes me for sleep.And that's about it for the positives. The negatives? Let's get started. Disclaimer- I do not typically write reviews. Seriously, look and see for yourself. The fact that I'm spending effort to write this speaks volumes to how disappointed I am with this product.1.) The mask lets in light. It's advertised as blackout- it's absolutely not. Even with faint light in the room, I can clearly see it through the mask. Granted, if you're in a room that's already dark, you won't notice, but if you're trying to sleep during the day, you will absolutely see noticeable light through the mask. Does it reduce the amount you see significantly? Yes. Is it black out, NO.2.) The velcro wears out in about a month. This is the SECOND one of these I've had from this company. I thought the first one may have been a fluke. It's not! This product WILL NOT LAST. The velcro is cheap and horribly made, and when it stops working, it renders the mask utterly useless, as it cannot be worn without the velcro keeping it wrapped around your head. Horrible design.The many many positive reviews you have seen are likely from people who have been using their mask for a very short time. Check out the ""all reviews"" section and read the ones with low ratings. We are all saying the exact same thing - the velcro does not work. If you want to spend $25 bucks on something that will work for a month, go nuts. If you're looking for a great mask that is both comfortable and will actually last, look elsewhere."
"I had a similar one prior and it was much better, was shorter and blocked all the light, including around the nose. This one is too big, smells like very strong perfume, and does not block the light which is the point of this."
"I was excited to try this Handmade Cotton Sleep Mask for its upgraded design and light-blocking features. However, my experience has been less than satisfactory. The Velcro on the back of the mask is of poor quality and the stitching tends to rip off when I try to remove it. Although the fitting is decent, the overall comfort of the mask is subpar."
"Envisioned this heavier than it is, very flimsy and doesn't stay put. Velcro loses holding ability thru the night and I'm primarily on my back or side."
The material on this mask was very nice. But the velcro strip did not last only a short while then it was good for nothing. Very disappointed.
I have a huge head but even for me this is too large. I have to pull the right velcro piece way past the left one or else if I connect the velcro pieces it's way too loose. So the velcro is just sticking loosely to the cotton and comes off really easily
Although HUGE - it doesn't block out light from below - gaps and a poor fit beneath the nose is the issue.
"Waited to review this. It's soft and feels good when wearing it, however after a few washes the velcro is no longer working to keep it on my head. Please fix this with better velcro."
Velcro stops working after a few months
Has helped me a lot with getting more sleep. All others have fallen off. Velcro stopped working and no it's pretty useless. I wished it would had lasted longer because it was very helpful for a bit.
"Soft material, but let's light through. Covers too much of your face for normal sleeping, which I found very uncomfortable."
Warmer than I'd hoped and the shape still allowed some light in. I really hoped it would work but it was not good.
The Velcro doesn't work
"Liked it at first, but after 4 months the velcrow stopped working. There's just only so many times you can wear before it loses stickiness. Would not buy again."
Loved this mask. Within three months of regular use the velcro has completley failed and the mask is now unusable. I will buy another mask of similar style elsewhere.
"Second time I've purchased this mask in a year. I've purchased many many mask on amazon and this has been the most comfy, problem is that is stretches out past the velcro so you no longer get a tight snug fit, I have a smaller head so it may work great for others, as for me I'll have to order another or have my wife sow a button on it."
Seems comfortable but have not been able to use it yet as it came perfumed and I need to wash and dry it to get the smell out.  It does seem like it will block light well.  But perfume ?
"Idk if I got a defective one? But not long after the Velcro totally gave out. I like a snug fit with eye masks so it no longer worked for me at all. When it did, it was sooo comfortable and soft."
"Between travel and weird shifts, I've tried numerous eye masks over the years.  I've never been able to find one that was comfortable. This one, however, is by far the most comfortable mask I've found. Soft and no parts that snag on your nose/eyes/ears.Alas, it is too good to be true.  The flaw is a less-than-stellar, essentially, ""off-brand Velcro"" strap that, eventually, fails to keep the mask attached to your face.  If you're lucky enough that the strap holds, it's amazing.  If not, welp, you'll be looking for another."
"This was an expensive purchase and was very excited based on other reviews. It is soft, lays flat and really blocks light well.  my biggest issue was the Velcro sizing.  There is only a short length to adhere and if you want it tighter, or the fabric stretches because its so soft, then you cannot make it smaller and close it tighter.  So then it just slides off and completely defeats the purpose.  I even went out and bought extra Velcro to try and tighten it but no luck.  ugh be warned!"
"The material is nice, but it suffers from the same flaw as every other mask: light gets in the bottom.  There should be extra padding around the eyes to prevent this.  It's taller than other masks, so you get more coverage around the eyes, but plenty of light still gets in.  Also, it's barely big enough for my head.  I wear a 7 3/4 fitted ball cap, which is on the large size of average, but there is barely enough velcro to hold it together in the back."
"I've has this mask since February. Initially I loved it. Fits, blocks almost all light, comfortable, soft. Sadly, the velcro fastener is not strong & wore out very quickly. Now, the mask is not secure & falls off in the middle of the night.  I followed all care instructions & only hand washed.Shopping for these is hard, so many out there & reviews don't always seem trustworthy. Going to start my search again. Not rebuying."
"It is comfortable but light does come in from nose area. The only reason I brought was because I thought it was completely light blocking. I didn't try to return because I believe one can move around the fabric or get another regular one underneath in order to achieve darkness but not sure. Next time I sleep somewhere where light comes in I will give it a try. The material is 100% blackout I think , however that area next to nose on both sides lets light in"
I like this sleep mask a lot. My only issue is that it doesn't block the light well enough for me. I need 100% light blocking and the material lets some light sleep through. The cut out at the nose often rides up a bit a light seeps through under the mask as well.
"The softness of the eye mask was certainly up to the mark. However, the velcro that holds the mask together while you sleep lost it's stickiness within 45 days of use, resulting in a mask that doesn't stay on while sleeping.For the price, I expected something that would last longer."
"Really comfy and soft. I wanted one that would not only cover my eyes but my ears and it does. Velcro on the back is comfy, not stiff or uncomfortable."
The product quality and softness is amazing. The only thing is that when lying down you might feel a pressure on the back of your head when having contact with the pillow. If you sleep sideways you would not feel it. Otherwise it's a very good product.
"This is probably the best sleeptime related purchase I've made. I'm an incredibly light sleeper that needs complete darkness and silence to sleep and stay that way.This sleep mask is wide enough that it covers my eyes and most of my forehead; when I wear it there's zero light getting through. It's incredibly soft and doesn't rub my skin wrong. It secures with a thick velcro strap at the back. If you have curly hair, I'd recommend sleeping with it piled on top of your head in a loose bun so the sleep mask doesn't flatten the top layer and ruin your volume or curl pattern the next day. Since it wraps around the head, it does cover my ears.It definitely doesn't block out sound but it does muffle enough that they're not annoyances. If you have a partner that snores obnoxiously I'd say pair the mask up with some ear plugs.My one complaint is that the fabric is likely to stain if you have oily skin or do a nighttime skin care routine. I myself have a bedtime routine that I top off with moisturizer, and I noticed a slight darkening on the front portion of the mask where it touches my skin. To help combat this, I wash the mask once a week in a delicate bag and haven't noticed the dark portion worsening. It also helps to make sure it doesn't get too stretched out. This could be a complete non-issue for different skin types, but I thought it'd be important to note anyway!"
comfortable and soft - easy to use
"I don't often leave reviews on items I purchase on Amazon (never actually), however, this face mask deserved a shout out.I'm adverse to black out shades because I love natural light and the look of sheer curtains. Living in Florida and bedroom window facing east, I had to find a comfortable eye mask to block out the streaming light at 6am. I normally hate eye masks because they never stay on, elastic is uncomfortable, eyelashes smushed, etc.This eye mask is SUPER comfortable and soft and truly does it's job blocking out all light.HOWEVER, I've only used it for a few months and the Velcro no longer sticks, at all, and I'm currently browsing for a new one. The Velcro became ""unsticky"" after just a few weeks, and within a few months, does not even close or stay on.Planning to get the same concept eye mask because it's perfect but trying a different brand this time that hopefully uses better quality Velcro…"
"The fabric is very soft. However it does hold heat a bit, so it may not be suitable for warmer climates or hot sleepers. A little bit of light does come in through the bottom, but this could just be because I have a large nose lol. If I could change one thing, I would add a bit of extra stuffing or a liner because light still gets through the fabric. It's not a problem for me, but if you need absolute darkness this mask might not be enough. I love the wide shape of this mask and the material. I might just alter the mask myself to make it block out more light..."
"I have to have complete darkness when I sleep, so when I bought this mask I had high expectations. The mask is very comfortable, however the Velcro on the back can be annoying at times. It does block out a good deal of light, but not around the nose area. Also, when you see reviews stating that the velcro loses its adhesive grip, they are 100% correct. After washing it got a little better, but after months of having it the velcro is not holding as well as it did before. If you are prone to sweating in your sleep, I do not recommend this mask. The Cotten is soft and comfortable, but can make your face hot during the night. I don't regret this purchase, however I do not believe it is worth $24 and would not purchase this item again. Try it out if you are curious and have the money, other than that this might not be the sleep mask for you.Ps. It makes my eyebrows hurt! Like when your hair has been in a ponytail all day and you take it out."
"Quite pleased with this purchase. The material is very soft, comfortable, and adjustable. Provides a strong amount of light reduction, which makes afternoon naps and times when I just need to shut my eyes much more bearable.  A good purchase!"
this doesn't have the cups to separate from the eyes but the bands are so wide that you really don't notice the pressure. The material is really cool temp wise and very very comfortable. The nose slot is of course not form fitting so a little light can get in through the bottom but I still prefer this because i turn in my sleep and like to lie sideways and this doesn't get tugged off my eyes like the ones with the normal little stripes.
"but delicate.  and when they say hand wash,  they mean it.  my wife washed two of mine and they were ruined.  .and the velcro strap is a bit stiff.  if i have any moisture issues with my cpap, this mask is a sponge.  otherwise, i like wearing it and have bought several"
Everything about this item is wonderful
"Apparently I have a big head because some sleep masks are too small but it fits, & it doesn't have an annoying metal thing where the strap joins the mask which would touch my temple which I'd hate--it's the only sleep mask I've found that doesn't."
"These sleep masks cover the ears as well as the eyes, so muffle the sound.  They come with ear plugs.  Light is cut out completely.  I have bought three (3) and given to family for airplane trips.  They have been as thrilled with them as I have. They are so soft and comfortable.  You won't be disappointed."
"This is the best eye mask ever. I purchased one a few years ago and bought another two for my parents. They love it, too."
"A foolish resistance fighter tried to breach the southern wall. We caught them using a combination of ancient Mayan hunting tactics and gutteral moaning, much like a wet bat trying to find food during a rainstorm. We captured them and blindfolded them using these. The prisoners lasted a brief period before falling asleep. We couldn't wake them, no matter how we tried, until morning.We believe these to be exceptional eye masks."
My wife (after using the mask for one night) said that this is the most comfortable sleep mask yet. Hopefully it stays as comfortable long term.
"Soft, fluffy, blocks out all light…just replaced my old one w a new one after wearing it every night for years. I love it"
"""Traditional"" sleep masks tend to pull at the eyes…this one does not. Comfy & blocks all the light. Love it."
"I have had a blackout mask for several years and loved it, except for the notch that is used to expand or shrink the headband. The Velcro on this sleep mask took some getting used to because I don't have a large head, so there is a bit of the strip that isn't held down by Velcro. Nevertheless, the mask blocks all light, which results in me being complete knocked out after my head hits the pillow."
So comfortable- really easy to adjust!
"It's comfortable and has the right geometry to cover everything and block the light, but it covers your ears, so you might start to get hot in your sleep."
"I'm a fan! It's a nice mask, very comfortable, very soft. I'm not sure if I love having something covering my ears, but that's a me thing, not a problem with the mask. Arrived punctually, and I like the little case + free ear plugs :)"
light still kinda peeps through the bottom and even through the mask itself when the light is bright enough. use in conjunction with curtains and it's great. also i like having my ears covered. i will say not great for acne because it does cover your whole forehead.
"I am VERY particular about sleep masks- I use one every night. While I love the softness and the coolness of this mask, the one item is that it keeps slipping slowly out of place and I find myself fixing it a few times during the night. Still better than most of the other masks I have tried."
"If you stay cool while sleeping, absolutely this will work well for you.  Post-menopause I am very warm while sleeping and this mask had me waking up soaked in sweat.  Excellent quality, good product, just not great for my situation."
I love how comfortable this sleep mask is.  I have a large head and I can adjust it to fit my big head easily.  Another nice feature is that I do not wake up with lines on my face that match the outline of the mask.  It is very soft and I really like it.  My only complaint is that it is not dark enough.  I wish it was black and have considered sewing on my black mask to the front of this one.  It blocks out most of the light but I feel that it could be darker.
"This sleep mask is very well made, and not heavy to wear. It is also easily packable on trips. It washes up really well, by hand or machine. It blocks excess light that might otherwise keep one from falling asleep. About the only con I have had is that, during warmer months it may cause you to sweat more when sleeping. But if you need a mask to block the light, this  works well, and is comfortably light weighted."
"Overall I'm happy with this purchase.  It provides a nice wrap around that I think makes it better than most products out there for sleep.  I've only had it for a couple of weeks so I can't speak to the durability, however it attaches with what seems to be a pretty robust hook & loop attachment so I'm not too worried.  Doesn't completely black out but compared to most standard eye patch products it does a good job.  Maybe a touch pricey for what you get, but overall I'd say money well spent.  Definitely more comfortable than it looks."
This was the best sleep mask I have ever used. I have this in July  2021. Why don't they put the reviews by date. The value will be by product and review date.
"Super comfy, and a great fitBut I found light still came through the nose.. that's the major downside.Wouldn't recommend for anyone looking for a 100% black out"
The velcro is incredibly loose and had to return. Its too bad because the mask is extremely soft.
It was comfortable but does not block the light completely
Very soft and comfortable but the Velcro does not hold. I have had it less than a month. Disappointed.
Velcro stopped working after a few weeks. Now there is no way to get this to stay on! Look elsewhere!
"I like this sleep mask, but the velcro stopped sticking after a couple months. now I can't use it"
Gaps at bottom - you'd think it would be wide enough but it's not
"Worked great for a month or two, then the Velcro wore out and now it won't stay attached throughout the night"
It's very soft and nice but just super bulky.
Loved this mask until it ripped in less than 3 months of using.
I did nt like it
"My hope was that habigm a wider surface area covered would stop it from sliding offy face at night. It does not, I tightened it as much as I could and it would slide off before I can fall asleep. It's SUPER soft and covers your ears which is cool, but I won't be using it anymore."
It works for the first few months. The velcro strip invariably fails over time. I'm thinking of modifying it to ensure a snug fit.
"I bought this mask over a year ago. It's lightweight, extremely soft, breathable, and very comfortable. After 9 months, the velcro stopped working, and it won't fasten together. I loved this mask, and it helped me get sleep that I was unable to get for years. I'm disappointed that it didn't even last 1 year."
No es tan acolchonada como parece y en la noche se desajusta de la cabeza. NO LA COMPREN.
This product let in a lot of light from around my nose bridge and also through the actual fabric. I found there was zero dampening of sounds with this item when worn without the ear plugs. I do think the item stays on well and is comfortable. I wish I had purchased the item in black for better blockage of light.
This was great until the velcro stopped working. The velcro is a great idea because most sleep masks don't fit my small head. I bought two within 6 months. They didn't last too long.
"It's soft, blocks the light, love how i can adjust the fit, but it is much thinner than i was expecting. No like comes through, but i do like to have a little weight on my eyes and thought the pictures made it look like it did. Still wear it though."
I sleep hot and this made me hotter. At first i liked it then found myself returning to the smaller more traditional sleep mask.
"Get loose after a while, Doesn't provide noise reduction even though it covers the ears"
The mask is soft and breathable and definitely helps with sleep.I would give it five stars but I have to dock two for the fact that the velcro wears out far too quickly - the manufacturer should look to switch it out for a different velcro that is more durable.
