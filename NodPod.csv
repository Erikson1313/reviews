"I have purchased several eye pillows and was surprised to find how effective this one is!  I love how the circularly shaped part in the middle sits on each of my eyes.  The fastening mechanism manages to be relatively secure without compromising your ability to sleep on it (a very difficulty balance!).  I tend to pull it off at some point during my sleep, but it doesn't fall off on its own.  I should note that I am a heavy sleeper -- the fastening mechanism might not work as well for someone who is restless.I deducted one star because I HATE the color pink and would have preferred the option of other colors."
Great product but a little overpriced. I use it every day now and even for daytime naps when I have to make up sleep from all night emergency work sessions when I'm on call.It's not as heavy as I expected but that is solved with the design It has for the wrap-around.What I love is HOW it is weighted.  You can use it easily slewing one your back OR in your side
It does a good job at sealing out the light. First it feels fine but after a few minutes it's a little heavy (and uncomfortable) on my eyes. I think a little less stuffing this would be perfect.  I like how it doesn't have to go around my head and it just kind of drapes over your eyes.
"Add me to the of happy sleepers who'd given up on sleep masks until finding the nodpod. It's comfortable and comfortING. I love the weight on my face, and the ""pods"" on the side don't prevent sleeping on my side. My only minor complaint is that the fastening process-pulling one end through a buttonhole on the other end--doesn't always ensure a secure fit through the night. Not enough of an issue to worry about and I'd buy another in a heartbeat. I'm looking forward to using it on my next long flight."
"I'm addicted to this product. It is my first sleep mask and I am so pleased with how easy it is to maneuver throughout the night.  I purchased it because I struggled to remain asleep when my husband got off work late at night and this has help tremendously. Also, my 5 yo tried it, loves it, and it puts him to sleep within minutes. My only complaint is that some of the stitching came undone within the first week."
"I ordered this because I thought it would help with migraines.  I usually use a weighted pillow or the warmth and weight of my husband's palm.  I used it the last few nights even though I didn't have a migraine.  It is a light weight band.  It stays securely around my head.  I bought the black one which also gives me a blackout effect.  That is an added bonus, because my bedroom gets a lot of sunlight."
"The item is fantastic!  The only issue I have (hence the 4 stars) is that it needs something to hold it tightly about my head.  The ability to loop it through the back is ingenious, but it fails to stabilize the hold.  Perhaps if a little Velcro could catch the remainder of what comes through the hole would help...?  I don't sew, so I have to knot the thing the keep it from sliding which it ""still"" does but not as badly."
"I loved this for a few months but eventually the beads fell out and I was unable to use it anymore. Would recommend more durable stitching to keep it all together, but was a good weight and texture for sleeping otherwise!"
I love this weighted eye mask.  My one complaint is that my eyes can't breathe and when I wake up they are dried out.  But it so comfortable and helps me sleep better the minor is worth it.  Mine stays on all night.  My husband's falls off in the middle of the night.  He loves his also.  We keep them in the freezer for a nice cool eye pack falling asleep.  Helps with my headaches.
"I really like the Nod Pod but have had an issue with the beads falling out!  One day I woke up to find beads all over bed.  One of the pockets had come undone. I picked up the beads and sewed the pocket back together.  Lately, I find a few beads at a time in the bed.  No visible openings in pod but, somehow, they are getting out.  For that price, I expected better quality!"
"I love the lime green. It's great for a side sleeper unlike the ones with elastic. I can be in any position and still use it. Wish the pockets were a little larger and a little heavier, but I love it still. Used it during a recent MRI (not metal in the design) to help reduce stress & claustrophobia, and at the dentist to reduce the bright lights as I get migraines from them. Perfect for that and for resting/sleeping."
"Don't get me wrong.  I'd buy these everyday and twice on Sunday if needed! They feel different. My husband really noticed in black,  the material feels thinner. I got pink this time. I have same issue.  Still love them. Hope the full quality comes back! Worth it though. ♡"
Ok but doesn't stay in place. When you fasten it in back than you have a limp behind your head.
"The weight of the mask is the perfect amount, not too heavy and not too light.  I find that I need to wear the mask with the ends secured since I don't stay in the same spot when I sleep. The bulkiness of the ends could be problematic if you're a back sleeper."
"Easy to use, delivers on claims to aid sleep. Use it every night."
"I do love this. It's soft and comfortable. But don't expect it to stay on. I've woken up to it around my neck, on my pillow, tucked in by my hip. Anywhere but where it's supposed to be. Lol. That could be because I'm a tosser/ turner. But what ever. At least I fall asleep with it on. I work split shifts and have to nap during the day and it blocks out the light without being a real heavy weight. And for those naps it's great. Stays on. But for the nighttime ""8 hours"" sleep time it won't stay on."
This is good for stomach sleepers or back sleepers. These might be uncomfortable for side sleepers because the weights are also on sides and you're laying down on the weighted parts. These were uncomfortable for me. I ended up putting this on top of my head when I sleep. The weight of it on my head helps calm down my anxiety.
i use this when i sleep. wont stay on if you move too much
"Highly recommend this for anyone that has trouble falling asleep like I do. The weights apply a gentle amount of pressure that keeps your eyelids closed and is very relaxing. I feel very well rested in the mornings when I use it. However, the design is poor. It's meant to be adjustable for everyone, but it is so poor that it doesn't stay on securely. If you roll around a lot it will not stay put unless you add some Velcro or something to help hold it in place. Overall, I do like it more than any other sleeping mask I've tried. I feel it's excellent quality but poor design."
"Love the product but disappointed that before I even washed it one of the seams split and the filling keeps going bwteeen the two pods. Like, within a month of use. That's not a great sign for quality and I had planned to order a second"
"This product is okay but I can't wear it well when I sleep on my side. My head is small, and I can't make this close tight enough for me. That also means it is bumpy on the side when I try it. I need you to make one with a smaller circumference."
"I agree with the commenters who wish there was a way to get it to secure more tightly.Until I started finding little plastic beads in my bed, I really liked the product.  I returned the one I had, but I'll probably get another.  Would have been four starts if it weren't for the bad stitching.  Five stars if you could secure it more tightly."
This sleep mask is too heavy.
"The material is very comfortable, soft on the skin. Unfortunately, the mask is too heavy, I woke up with marks on my face, and really hard to open my eyes after a night of sleep."
"The mask slips off and if you like sleeping on your side you can feel the filling (feels like hundreds of small balls inside) patching into your ear.. not very comfortable , it would make a much better product if it was foam inside, not plastic balls"
Having to tie this vs some form of Velcro creates a big knot behind the head which makes this near impossible to be comfortable in that regard. Weight is nice but big knot leaves this needing a better engineered way to secure it on your head.
"When pulled tight, the tension does help my migraines somewhat but too uncomfortable to wear long. Also, as stated in past reviews, it's difficult to keep it tight. I am not happy enough with it to go to the trouble of adding Velcro and buttons."
If you are a side sleeper this is not for you. Perfect for back sleepers. The Weight is perfect and does exactly what you want it to do.  But this product doesn't snap or velcro in only loops through a hole and if you are a side sleeper will fall down or up.
"I didn't realize this was a weighted sleep mask when I got it. I thought it was some gel or memory foam maybe. Wasn't interested or in the market for a weighted mask at all. But since I had it, I figured why not give it a try. Well turns out I really like this thing. I think it does actually help me fall asleep believe it or not. It definitely blocks out all light once it's on. And you could use it on trips or a plane if you wanted, because of the ability to tie it. Although I think it's kind of heavy to be traveling with in my personal opinon. I find a cheaper silk mask is still best for that situation. But all in all I ended up loving this thing even though I honestly didn't realize what it was. And quite frankly I was kind of skeptical when I tried it. I really was just going to return it and buy one of the other well rated non weighted masks. Glad I decided to give it a try.I definitely suggest you give this a try. The material is soft and two sided if you prefer a cooler side. It's adjusts to your sleep style. And it has a few color options. It's a bit on the expensive side in comparison to other sleep masks but then again they aren't weight and they can't be put in the freezer and double as a cooling pack. So I'd actually say the value is pretty good value for a weighted mask. I will admit though that I don't think this will be for everyone. Some people will probably just never like the feeling of the weight on their face, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a shot for a night and test to see. It's not like it costs hundreds of dollars to try."
"I've tried a few traditional eye masks in the past, but none fit the bill. The headband-style masks were always either too loose or too constricting, or fit well but did a poor job of blocking light. I was a little skeptical of the Nodpod at first, because I thought maybe the weight on my eyes would be uncomfortable. I figured I'd give it a try and if I hated it, I'd send it back. Once I tried it, though, I was pleasantly surprised that the small amount of weight is indeed quite soothing. The beads inside the pods also do a better job of conforming the mask to my face than any of the others I've tried. After some minor adjustment, there are no crevices for rays to peek through. I'm so glad I gave it a try."
"LOVE. Only downside is when you forget to pack her. Don't forget she is machine washable, will break you out if you aren't washing enough"
This is fantastic for sleeping.  I love the softer side
"I thought this would be a scam or a social media fad, but was delightfully shocked at how wrong I was. To preface, I have struggled with insomnia and ptsd for many years and have since struggled to find a sleep remedy. I am prescribed sleep meds, drink tea before bed, etc etc and have not found anything COMPARABLE to the sleepnod sleep mask. This actually does make a significant difference within three minutes and has without a doubt been a ""cure all"" for me. So good that after trying this for only three nights that I purchased another for my roommate. I cannot stress enough how incredibly this works."
Bussin. The most bussin sleep I have ever gotten.
"My husband loves this sleep mask. He said it has just the right amount of weighted pressure against his eyes, and likes that one side feels a bit cooler than the other. He likes to use the cooler side when he has a headache. He doesn't like to fasten his eye masks. He does not lose this one like the others. It's a little longer than some if the others, and we chose yellow to make it less difficult to lose in the covers. So far, this is a winner!"
"This thing is a game changer. I thought the closure in the back would be an issue, but its not. I'm also a side sleeper most of the time and don't have an issue with it staying on. I will say though, this thing puts me into a deep sleep. I try not to wear it on days when I need to get up early because it blocks out so much light and the weight is so relaxing I can't get up!"
Best sleep mask out there! I've tried lots of different eye mask since I move a lot in my sleep and this is the other one I love. Yes it falls off sometimes but overall is very comfortable. Just enough weight for your eyes to fall into a deep sleep. This is my second one and will always be my go to eye mask
"I used to sleep with a pillow over my head yo cover ears and eyes (my oldest son has done the same since the day he was born).  Long enough to cover eyes and ears if you're laying on your back or on your side. These are great, but would be nice if they were a bit less expensive. $35 is a crazy amount for it.  But did I buy 3, yes I did."
How are you supposed to keep this on? Only good if you are on your back.
Very comfy if you never move
blocks light but would have liked a little more weight.  Hard to  insert into slit provided to wrap around head.
Was awesome for the first week but then melted after only a few seconds in the microwave :(
Like the product but it's a little heavy on the eyes.
"Let's first acknowledge how amazing the weighted mask feels just laying in bed and relaxing. It's like an off switch for my brain if I want 10 minutes of peace. I love the slight pressure on my eyes when it lays just right.But that's the problem. It's damn near impossible to get it to lay just right. To get the beads inside to equally distribute so that each side is sitting evenly and the pressure is consistent. If you're the type of person that has anxiety and hyperfocuses or fixates on small differences this mask will drive you bonkers. You'll never get the thing to center correctly or the beads to settle just right.Now say you aren't an obsessive perfectionist but just someone that varies their sleep position through the night. A tosser and turner if you will….but not even in the restless way. In the ""I love when I roll over and find a new spot of cool sheet and pillow under me"" way. This mask has to be taken off and repositioned to accommodate each and every effing position change all. night. long.  You finally get it right while laying on your back and all you can think about is how badly you want to turn to your side…and if you need to get up to pee in the middle of the night? Oof. The dang thing is tossed on the nightstand and left as a lost cause at that point.If it had a way to secure it more firmly behind your head… or fewer weighted pockets so no matter how you lay you didn't have to slide it left or right like the sleep version of an early 2000s song you dance to at weddings… and perhaps if the pockets were sewn just a bit tighter to keep the beads from shifting around…This product is excellent for a very particular type of sleeper. It will not drape across your lids and magically turn you into that type of sleeper either. Are you a type A sheet surfer with obsessive tendencies? Might be better to go find a mask with a strap."
"I want to like this.  It's very soft, the weight is good, and I LOVE the back closure (velcro on my old mask was pulling at my hair).  BUT, I hate that the eye pieces aren't contoured.  It sounds like some people like it, but it pushes on my eyelids and is uncomfortable.  I like the weight around the eye socket area, but prefer my actual eyes to be free to move, and not feel like the mask is smashing my eyelashes and rubbing my eye cream off."
"I like the NodPod overall. The material is soft and it's actually pretty comfortable to wear. I don't find myself adjusting it like other masks I've tried, and I like that you can either wear it tied around your head or just lay it across your eyes, the latter of which is great for my yoga cool down, especially after I've had it in the freezer. It does a mostly good job of blocking light, but I have a pink one, so the lighter color tends to let a little bit of light through when the sun is out. I always wish I got a darker color so that it would block light better.But I have one major complaint. Whenever I wear the NodPod overnight, I wake up with extremely blurred vision, to the point where I can't even read my phone or the clock, and it usually takes over an hour to correct itself. I don't wear glasses or contacts, so normally my vision is fine. I know I'm not tying it too tight because it falls right off my head when I sit up. Despite the comfort, maybe the weight is just putting too much pressure on my eyes. I can't imagine that wearing this every night is good for me so I'll probably just continue using it for short periods, like if I have a headache or after yoga.So I like it, but I just can't wear it overnight."
"I have been sleeping now for five days with non-pod and it's OK. The weighted  part of the mask goes from one temple around to the other temple and if you're a side Sleeper like I am then  the weighted beads  on the temple are uncomfortable and leave my neck in an awkward position . There is a button hole that you put the fabric through to tighten it up and the buttonhole is already stretched out and the fabric comes loose so it slides. For something this pricey it should really be exceptional , The one nice thing about it is there is no Velcro. Haven't decided whether to send it back or not. I will probably give it a few more days to see. I do think this is way overpriced for the product."
"Edit: after three months of using this I'm sad to say that I do still wish this was heavier. I am still having trouble sleeping again even after using this consistently. I really hoped I had found something to help me long term but I guess the search continues. The quality is good, it just doesn't work for me."
Why in the world would they not have some Velcro or SOMEthing to keep it closed??  I'd return this but I don't see any alternative.  I like the weight and the comfort but for this price ??  Ridiculous
"The weight, and the cool and warm sides were perfect. However, it would not stay on my head. Threading one end through the slit is a poor design...nothing secures the hold"
The weight is tiny beads that have no structured positioning which make is annoying to use.
"This is so uncomfortable it's almost useless.  I would have returned it, but I waited too long after a vacation to do so."
Very heavy / light is not completely trapped
Uncomfortable
I've considered buying one of these for several years but the price always stopped me. Recently my boyfriend randomly decided to buy it for me.As soon as I took it out of the packaging I was convinced I had received a counterfeit. The texture was sort of rough and not velvety and the weight seemed insubstantial. I even went online and looked at pictures of other ones because I was sure this could not be an item that was priced at 40$This is a weird comparison but it's extremely accurate: remember how the real beanie babies were super soft and velvety and had weight to them? (That's sort of what I imagine the nodpod would feel like) Then McDonald's came out with happy meal beanie babies and they were made of scratchy material and didn't have that heft to them. The nod pod is like the same texture as the McDonald's beanie babies and feels like it's filled with styrofoam beads.
The product should have been more weighted and doesn't stay on.
"I'm an active sleeper often moving around and flopping from side to side. As you can imagine, this design doesn't cater well to the activity and usually ends up around my neck in the morning. It's soft and a great weight but this doesn't stay put unless you do."
1. Got the grey and it smelled very strong.2. Very awkward fit. Wouldn't stay in place and the weighted balls on the side were pulling it off of me.
"I like the shape, design and concept of this sleep mask.  It's comfortable for the most part and the design enables you to drape it across your face comfortably whether you are sleeping on your back or side.  The only problem I have experienced is that the weight of the beads presses against my corneas so that I awaken with irritated eyes if I have been sleeping on my back.  After I drape the mask across my face I sort of squish the beads into the surrounding area of the pouches leaving the part directly over my eyes free and that does help somewhat, but the beads do seems to drift back into place while I sleep.  If I were going to design this for myself I would probably use less weight in the two center pouches."
I was expecting this product to be more substantial for the price. It seems very lightweight. A little disappointing. Tried it for a night and wasn't impressed. I do think I'll keep it because I like that you can freeze it and can add it to my collection of ice packs for my head when I have migraines.
"I'd wanted this since the first time I saw it, but for me, it doesn't work as wonderfully as I had hoped.  The sections were unevenly filled with beads, the ""cool"" side was a fabric that wasn't necessarily ""cool"", and importantly, the buttonhole was so small it was impossible to thread the other end thru it.  Great concept, but possibly more product control is needed."
It doesn't stay on when Rossi g and turning have to constantly keep  readjusting will be returning this item
"Bought it for my mother and she didn't care for it so I tried it out.  While it's soft, for me it's not as effective as a simple sleep mask.  Heavy so it slips and requires adjustment during the night.  Disappointed since it was costly and highly rated."
All beads fell out when cleaning this
I'm so disappointed with this. It's itchy on my eyes so I can't sleep with it. Also not as heavy or large as I hoped. So expensive and really not worth it
"Positives: keeps out the light; added benefit of covering ears once done up which keeps out the noise too. Helps to reduce puffy eyes in the morningNegatives: does not stay tied up; moves around during the night; because of constant retightening during the night, thread has torn and beads are falling out. I've only used about 5 times since January given I couldn't figure out how to keep it on so I didn't get good use out of it for $40If they just figured out a way to properly secure it, it would be ALMOST worth it"
"Another one of those this will help you sleep scams.  Again, I read a review that swore this weighted mask is the best thing since sleeping pills.  My version of the review.I have gone to sleep wearing this, usually with the help of a sleeping pill.  I used it for several weeks. I tended to pull it off in the night.  Haven't used it in weeks. The mask is much larger than a flat mask.  Is not always comfortable if you sleep on your side.  I  forget I have it, that should answer if it works.It might work for some people, not for me."
"I really loved this product at first. After wearing it for a few minutes, it felt too heavy on my eye lids. I wish I could take out 15-20% of the weight bc it would be perfect then!"
"Its meh, if you sleep straight on your back and only back i could see this being amazing otherwise doesnt work that great."
Not as heavy as I thought it would be. Also doesn't stay on the head quite well enough when you change sleeping positions. Feels too warm after a few hours. I am back to using a long black slip which is cooler and more comfortable.
"This is the first product review I've written in a long time. I was compelled to write this because using Nodpod sent me into the deepest sleep of my life. I was skeptical, but after seeing a few ads on TikTok, I decided to give it a try to see if it would help relieve some pressure I get in my eyes when I'm trying to fall asleep. I don't think I laid down for more than 1 minute before I was asleep. It is comfortable, soft, and well worth the money. I will be gifting these to everyone I know.IF YOU ARE ON THE FENCE, BUY THIS."
"For years I've had light insensitivity... See the morning light and oh boy I'm awake and never going back to sleep. So I tried mask after mask after mask. My grandma puts a heavy washcloth over her eyes then seals it with a mask, which I started to do but then I have lines all over my face when I wake up.Then I discovered this Nod Pod, after searching for -yet again- another sleep mask. I was skeptical, since it doesn't secure to the head and didn't seem traditional. But, but, but... It works!!Since there is a a light amount of pressure on my eyes, I don't compulsively open them (that became a problem with a regular sleep mask to ""check"" if there was light coming through), which means I don't see light, which means I keep sleeping... The pressure is so light but feels so good. It's like a hug on my eyelids each night/morning. I've never ""secured"" it behind my head, just leave it draped over my head and it has not been a problem. I've somehow learned to adjust/reposition as I roll over in the middle of the night. The fabric also feels so great, like cuddling a blanket. I even take this amazing little piece of comfort camping with me and I finally, FINALLY sleep in past sunrise.I never write reviews this incredibly long or detailed, but thought I would in case someone is in the same place as me with endless masks and stress coming from light insensitivity while sleeping. I get it, the price is higher than a basic ole mask, and really it's just some beans or rice in a piece of fabric, but it's done perfectly and it WILL change how you sleep. Best of luck!"
"These help so much with sleep, and travel way better than a weighted blanket. This is my fourth one that I've owned.It's cool on one side and warm on the other, feels great after being set in the freezer for a while (especially for migraine headaches), shuts out all the light, and is comfortable because it doesn't squeeze my head like the headband variety of sleep mask, nor does it pinch at the ears like the mask variety. Just lays over the eyes and stays there, even works while laying on my side. You *can* tie it around your head if you want, I just never do.They have to be washed sometimes, though. I suppose it might last longer if only washed by hand, but I use the washing machine. I put it in a protective bag, use the hand wash cycle on my washing machine, and then let it air dry. But after a handful of washes, the cool side fabric starts to really wear thin.Still worth it, though."
"Love it!  Great at keeping the bright morning light out of my eyes when I'm trying to sleep late.  Cool side feels comfortable.  Haven't tried the warm side yet.  Difficult to get the flap through the hole but once I did, it worked really well."
"This has been a game changer for me. I change positions a lot when I sleep and this is fantastic for side, back, and stomach sleeping. It blocks light well and can adjusted for any gapping. Very comfortable weight and fabric. It usually falls off by the morning, but I prefer that bc I need the light to wake up. I like the gentle pressure on my eyes and that there isn't a strap to crease my hair"
"I love these so much, I ordered some as gifts and for travel. They are wonderful in blocking out light, stay on without any issues, and are was to clean."
"I've used a number of sleep masks. The research is positive on sleep masks, lots of positive cognitive benefits. But THIS sleep mask is the BEST sleep mask ever. Cool on one side. Warm on the other. Washable. You can sleep on your back or your side. If you lose it in the middle of the night, you can find it in the dark no problem because it makes the slightest rustle. Other sleep masks go around the head; issues: if you move your head, doesn't fit right; messes with your hair; if it does stay on all night you wake up and it's bright outside, which is super odd. THIS ONE HAS NONE OF THESE ISSUES!!! YOU MUST TRY IT!! I bought one for several friends and family members and my husband and we all love it!"
"I'm a fan of weighted blankets and normally fall asleep more quickly if i have some form of pressure. Weighted blankets can be too restricting sometimes and heavy duvet covers are too hot. This thing is so nice though! It's not too heavy either, i like that i don't have to adjust it if i roll over. Definitely using this next time i get a migraine too! The sage green is pretty :) if you have a hard time falling asleep give this a try!"
We each have one and fall asleep so quickly!
It's really comforting and good at blocking light. The weight is Not too heavy. I've washed it a few times and had no issues on a gentle cycle.
Way better than a normal sleep mask. I love that it is a little bit weighted.
"I have had sleep/eye masks in the past and this take it to a whole new level. The light ""pressure"" from the weighted mask puts me right to sleep. Stays on my face all night!"
"Love it, not too heavy but just enough gentle pressure to help me fall asleep. I love using this with my weighted blanket. Only downside is it not always reliable for when sitting upright like if you were on a road trip but the little slit allow you to kinda tie it in place to help it stay up."
This is a wonderful and comfortable type of a sleep mask! The best I've ever tried in the past.
"Very confortable, I can sleep better after getting this, I love it."
"I was reluctant to buy this, but three days into wearing it, I fell in love. I've slept the deepest and least interrupted sleep in YEARS over the last week of using my Nodpod! It takes a little getting used to, but it seriously works."
"If you like weighted blankets, you'll love this! If you don't sleep with a weighted blanket you'll still love this!Light (of any sort) at night can disrupt your sleep, so I bought this to help with that. The fabric is soft on both sides and doesn't bother my sensitive skin at all. The ‘pods' for each eye socket area fit perfectly, and you can adjust them based on your sleeping position; there are like 6 pods I think, plus extra flat fabric at each end. When I roll over I just grab an end, and adjust the pods as I want, and then fall right back to sleep.This is a very soothing product, and will help you to relax. I have tried about 5 different eye masks, and this is above and beyond anything else I've tried.If you have difficulty falling asleep (not related to sleep apnea) this will definitely help you. I would also recommend it as a relaxation tool. It's my favorite purchase from Amazon for ages!! Give it a try- you'll be surprised how much it helps you get better sleep 🤓"
Bought this for my dog. He loves it!
"I was somewhat skeptical of this.  I was looking for a sleep mask to block the light when I came upon this. I ended up ordering an inexpensive light blocking mask, but I kept coming back to look at this for a few weeks and finally ordered it about nine months ago.I questioned whether it would work at all, and especially for a side sleeper like me.I know it sounds exaggerated, but I now almost always wake up in the position I fell asleep in. I'm not nearly as restless nor move as much in the night. I never had issues with insomnia, so it's not like it's been a miracle. But I really do get better sleep.As a side sleeper I just drape it across the side of my head and bend it to cover my eyes. I don't wrap it all the way around. I'm not exaggerating when I say I wake up with it in the same position after six or seven hours every night.I would say it's definitely worth a try if you're curious.I'm so glad I did.I've purchased another one."
"I was nervous buying this at first but I'm so glad I did! I tend to toss and turn some, but for the most part it stays in place! I have a street light outside my window and I don't have blinds, so I get a lot of light all hours of the day and night. The mask does a good job of blocking out light. I also have really curly hair and I didn't want a mask with a strap, so this is perfect and has been great with the hair. The only thing is that at first, I woke up with headaches, I'm assuming because of the weighted aspect, but I'm fairly used to it now. I think it was more so that I needed to adjust. So fair warning if anyone is sensitive!Now all I need to do is figure out how to quickly adjust to going from massive darkness to very bright mornings when I wake up and take my mask off lol"
"I bought 2 of these mask from Amazon. One pink one black. Then I found a gray one at Marshall's. I've been using all 3 for months now. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1. It's weighted- very relaxing2. You don't have the wrap it around your head in  any position3. The black one blocks out all the light4. WashableCons:1. They all broke almost immediately. The black one broke as soon as I took it out of the box. The gray one broke after one night of use. By broke I mean all the beads spread everywhere inside the mask. The pink one broke after washing it, the beads came out and spilled all over the washing machine. I had to stitch it make together.2. The pink and gray don't block out the light3. Eye lashes get bent towards opposite sides. It gets worse when I try to curl my lashes and put mascara.4. Have to repair after almost every wash.5. The fabric feels cheap, specially the ‘cool' side6. ExpensiveI use my eye mask every single day. I'm currently looking for a different one. Definitely not worth the price. I should have kept using a shirt."
"I had high hopes and really wanted to love this sleep mask. I've tried lots of masks and have slept with one for over 15 years. I do like the weight and softness, but there are just some things I don't like. I'm a side sleeper and the mask is bulky under my head which is hard to get used to. I also roll over quite a bit at night and get up with toddlers and the mask doesn't stay put on the top of my head when I push it up to see. It's slips around and falls off a lot which is annoying to have to readjust. I'm currently using it on top of another sleep mask that stays in place and keeps the light out better. It's just ok…maybe I should design my own."
"Pros- very comfortable and soft- packaging is nice- not too heavy (partially a con)- works well with a CPAPCons- only blocks about 60-70% of light- each beaded section is only about 1.85 oz and doesn't feel heavy enough- smaller than expectedI bought this mask after seeing a few reviews that it works really well with a CPAP mask. I didn't want to have another thing wrapped around my head if I could avoid it. And in terms of comfort, this thing is great. Felt really nice to use.However, the main reason I needed a mask in the first place was to block the light from my window. It gets really bright around 6-7AM. The Nodpod does block most light but quite a lot still bleeds through as you can see in my photos. The first photo is the light directly on the Nodpod and the second is about 2.5 inches away. For comparison, I did the same thing with a free eye mask from a flight (only took photos of the light directly on the mask). No light shines through it at all. It's just a bit tight and uncomfortable.Also, while I'm glad it's not too heavy, the weighted sections could stand to be a little heavier. They're pretty light as you can see from my pictures. I weighed the whole product then weighed the ends. Doing some math, [(9.07 -(2*0.85))/4] (weight of product - weight of both ends all divided by 4) you get that each pod is about 1.85 oz. For comparison, that's less than 2 AA batteries.Lastly, the Nodpod is smaller than I expected. The ones the model uses covers like half their face. At its widest, the Nodpod only measures about 3.25"". I wonder if they remade it to be smaller or if it's just false advertisement. Either way, the Nodpod doesn't really do anything that I needed it to. It isn't heavy enough to feel like a weight blanket, it doesn't block light, and is outperformed by a cheap eye mask."
"I had SUCH high hopes for this product; I love draping part of my weighted blanket over my head/eyes at night because it helps me relax, so I've been looking for a mask alternative that's a little bit easier to move around. For the life of me, I cannot understand why this has such a good reviews — it literally has the weight of a Beanie Baby plushie. It's just a beanbag. And not a particularly heavy one, at that. Even if you liked it, it is in NO WAY worth $37. Maybe 15 bucks at best. Had to return on principle for that reason"
"I bought one of these a year ago, lost mine and just repurchased. I knew right away they had changed the design. The product is now significantly lighter than my last nodpod, you can barely feel any weight on your face. It slides around and falls off because it is so light now, my other one stayed on all night. Not sure if this is a cost saving thing or what, but I am so bummed. I also got the wisteria color and it hardly blocks out any light. It's ok at night but in the morning it becomes a problem. Do NOT get anything other than the black color if you want to block light. I will use this but I am definitely not happy and wish I had my old one back :("
"If this was cheaper, it would be a decent sleep mask.  Given the price, it's not worth it.Pros: Super soft, design and premise is great, small balls for filling makes it flexible enough to truly conform to your eyesCons: not weighted (very light filling), the hole to loop the end through is barely big enough to fit my finger let alone a chunk of fabricHad it lived up to it's advertised 'weighted' feel it might be great.  But to pay this much for just another soft mask it's worth it."
"Unfortunately was really disappointed in this sleeping mask. It doesn't stay on even when positioning it behind the head. I sleep on my side which this advertised the mask was good for, but in order to have it on while on your side some of the weighted part of the mask covers your ear and is really uncomfortable. The positive was it was soft and can stay cool but just didn't work for me."
I love it and love the feel of the mask… however only after using it 2 nights I see the stitches have came apart in 2 sections and the beads are bunching up in other pods. I can't imagine how bad it will be after a month. I really wanted to love this!!! But for spending this kind of money I need a better quality product. :(
"Nice product -- I ended up returning it though it was a tough call.PROS:-It was pleasantly surprised; this was soothing and calming.  The weight seems to be the right amount.It is 110% light blocking for those sensitive to light.-If you have anxiety or sleep issues, I think this does help calm you down.  It's not a sleeping mask, more like a meditation or relaxation mask you can use before bed and if you tend to wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep.-It did seem to help me get back to sleep in the middle of the night more quickly and easily.  I did seem to sleep more deeply.-I was torn as to whether to keep it or not, but I decided to return bc I wanted more of a mask to wear all night for sleeping and also, ultimately, I didn't like the price.  I wanted something functional but less $$.-It falls off but is easy to find in the middle of the night because it's so long.-You can also rest pods on ears while it's on your eyes if that helps.CONS:Is it healthy to put weight on your eyes?  I'm going to ask my eye doc.  I started to feel like it wasn't a good idea for me.Slides around.  Doesn't stay on.  For this reason it helps with falling asleep.  Not nec staying asleep.IMO, overpriced at $36"
"These are great for migrains, but not for sleep.Despite the design, part of your brain is always waiting for these to fall off. If you strap them down, nothing is flat behind your head, so it's a little uncomfortable.Forget side sleeping, just doesn't work for me..."
"These come in a really cute package. Af first, I loved every about these. However, after  a month of wearing this every night the beads have moved to one side and I am unable to get them back in the right spot."
"I was excited for this because I love a weighted eye mask. I wanted to buy black but they were unavailable so I bought pink. Light from the TV still shown through the fabric, not even from a crack. You would think they wouldn't make an eye mask that light could pass through. I also feel like the design made sleeping too complicated. I regret the money I spent on it."
"This product cause a reaction on my face. Small red bumps where the fabric came in contact. Full transparency, I did not wash it before using it the first time. After the reaction, I washed it on the gentle cycle and waited a few days before trying it again.And it happened again.I'm disappointed because I liked the product itself. But I won't use it at the expense of my skin."
"This was barely heavier than my normal sleep mask. I also rotate between back and side sleeping, and there's no way to fasten it so you can do both"
"So much is going well with this product, it's sad to have to give it a bad review but it lets in a ton of light — the fabric isn't thick enough and is also the wrong color to do it's job effectively: block light for a deeper more restful sleep. Fail."
"I feel like this product was a great idea, but whoever created it needs to make some adjustments with how well it stays on. This is not stay on well at all. It always falls off no matter how tight you adjust it and it is not good for traveling either. It is way too heavy and falls off your eyes. If you use it laying down and you turn to adjust yourself, it falls off, and you have to readjust it."
"I like this, it is wonderful if I have a migraine , but it is impossible to use at night. Even after tightening it, it falls off. They market it for side sleepers, but the only way this would work is if you slept on your back and didn't move at all.I also had to return and reorder as they originally sent me a used one that had animal fur on it."
"Really loved my mask, but after less than a month of use the sewing has let go, and now one bubble is flat...pretty much cant use it"
"Not that heavy, the divinding seem broke almost immediately making it lopsided. Over priced for the product."
"This did absolutely nothing to help improve my sleep.  It's personal, so maybe it might work for someone else."
For a sleep mask to be so much more expensive then others you would expect better quality. The item after 1 wash on delicate already has seems coming loose and microbeads falling out. The item is soft and comfortable but just not worth the cost compared to other sleep masks.
"I ordered this after I left my beloved Manta sleep mask in a hotel while traveling. I just am disappointed all around. I wanted to love it - I really did. Even the ""cool"" side of this mask makes me sweat. It is super uncomfortable for side sleeping and either leaves you resting your head on a ""pod"" or it is just going to slip around and off your face the first time you move. I am going back to Manta sleep masks."
"Product not worth the expensive price. Unnecessary Expensive packaging! fabric way too hot, even on what's supposed to be the cool side! I actually sweat around my eyes & you don't sleep when you sweat! It did block light. Should have returned, would not recommend. Needs some redesigning with changing to a cooler fabric & I thought it to be too bulky too much fabric, too heavy & less fancy packaging to lower the price!"
"The old Nodpod was heavier, fabric was softer & nicer and it was well made. The one I just ordered feels light, cheap and flimsy and MORE expensive! Very disappointing!!!"
"I must be a more restless or sensitive sleeper than over 150 others who reviewed and loved this product.  I bought it mainly to block out light when I was sleeping. It was uncomfortable no matter how I positioned myself or the Nodpod.Draped across my eyes —either on my side or back—it would slip off.Tucked under my head when I lay on my side or stomach—lumpy and uncomfortable.With one tab slid through the other in any position—also uncomfortable.Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it was if no use to me whatsoever.If anyone has any tips, please let me know."
I toss and turn alot at night. And honestly there are two main weighted parts for the eyes which are amazing. But the ones on the side push on your temple.
"I loved this eye mask, have used it for over a year... but what I've noticed is that my eyelashes have started growing in unnatural directions and are in complete disarray. The pressure from this mask most definitely had some influence on this situation I'm in. I wonder if I'm alone in this. I will not be using it anymore... it's time to give my eyelashes a dang break."
The mask does not stay fitted to your face and slips off easily. If your a side sleeper don't buy these.
"I knew the mask was weighted, but was surprised by how much. I expected it to be fitting to my face, but not squishing my eyeballs weight, and maybe this was my mistake. The mask itself though is not wide enough. It covers you eyes, but needs more width to keep out light"
I was surprised that it reminded me of a beanie baby. Don't think it's worth the price.
"I got this from a deal on ""The View"" hoping it would put some weight on my eyes for relaxation. There is barely any weight and I'm pretty disappointed to have something I paid for that I will be discarding."
Overall I like this product but the pictures show a sewn hole in one of the sides so you can thread the other side into it and mine doesn't have that so I have to rely on gravity. Not sure if I'm going to return because I do like the product but for the price I'm not sure it's worth it
Kept falling off of my face even when tied in the back. Looks nice and the idea feels relaxing but it doesn't do much
Just too heavy on my eyeballs.  Not for me.
"The actual product I received was MUCH smaller than the photo or video included on the listing with the pretty blond girl having a wonderful night's sleep.  Also, the ""slit"" in the back is so small that it is almost impossible to tie this at the back of the head without enlarging the slit with a pair of scissors.  Finally, it can be washed, but not put in the dryer, and it takes many days to air dry completely.  The weight that is supposed to be so relaxing on the eyes isn't really because the product isn't as big as is shown."
"Product states to wash before using. After first gentle wash, one of the seams broke so the inside beads aren't broken up between 2 of the pods. This makes it more difficult and not as comfortable to use throughout the night as I would assume it'd be if all 4 pods were separated by the seam."
The weight could be better. But it does help with headaches.
"It's very difficult to keep this product on my face when I am sleeping. It falls off easily, cannot be adjusted to fit a smaller face and once it falls off if you wake up it's purpose is defeated. 😕I wish I could adjust it to fit my face as it is very soft and just the right weight!"
Finally found the perfect sleep mask for my migraines
I thought I had read that the NodPod could also be warmed in the microwave in addition to cooled in the freezer. The directions mention not heating it in the microwave.I do like the comfort level and weight. I wanted the advantage of having weighted and heated sections on my temples when experiencing a migraine. But it can't happen apparently.
"I've tried to like this on numerous occasions. It does block out all light which is fantastic but it puts a ton of pressure on my eyes which makes my migraine worse. And you have to make sure that they're directly lined up. But my biggest complaint is that it should have Velcro or something to keep it secure because the way it is now you have to slip this big piece through a small slit and pull it through to tighten it and it doesn't state heightened and it leaves a big bump so it's uncomfortable.  Maybe one of my friends will have more luck with that than I do. It just seems to hurt my face more than it should, but I also have a lot of health issues so that could be part of the reason why. But the back really needs to be reworked regardless...."
"It's ok, took forever to arrive and is about half the size that's pictured on the model.  Just big enough to cover eyes, very lightly weighted. Not really what I expected based on photos/other reviews."
"I have been eyeing this product for months and finally took the plunge - everything about it seemed like it would help me fall asleep. It is soft, pretty and well made, though I expected it to be a bit bigger all around. My problem is that I sleep with my head slightly elevated and no matter what I tried (and I wanted to love this thing) the Nodpod slipped down my face within seconds. Additionally, I am particularly sensitive to light. I ordered the coral colored one and could see faint brightness, even with my eyes closed, so if you are considering this item and have light sensitivities, you may want to consider a darker color."
"It is comfortable, but the stitching came apart in two places (in less than a month) so now the beads from two of the 'pockets' travel through them all the way to one of the corners. For the price, I would hope for stronger or better quality stitching."
"While it looks like the mask is very comfortable and will get the job done, sadly the one that was shipped to me doesn't have the slit that it should have, so there's no way to secure it. So be warned that you may have to return it to get a non defective one."
"I was really excited about this product but it's not really what I thought it would be like.1) there's a tiny hole you have to pull the other strap in. I tried that last night and it never stayed. I then tried to tied it and woke up later and that also didn't stay. I'm probably going to have to buy some Velcro and sew it on to make it work.2) Those microbeads move around and depending on how you lay, they shift. Sometimes they shift to under your eye or to the side and it doesn't feel right. The only way you have an even amount of pressure is if you lay straight on your back. So if you're a side sleeper like me, it won't feel as comfortable or right."
this isn't that great and i was so excited to get it because i love using a sleep mask and i get awful headaches. it's almost impossible to keep on for an extended period of time so you can't really wear to sleep in. it could be a lot heavier too. the cold is nice and i keep it in a plastic bag in my freezer so it doesn't collect smells from the freezer as i hate smells especially when i get a headache. it's just alright. i would return it if i hadn't used it already. save ur money and buy a cheaper sleep mask or ice pack
"I had high hopes for this, but didn't feel that my sleep quality had changed because of it. I like that it has a cotton side (I can't stand the feel of the polyester-fleece side)."
"It's packaged cute but doesn't work. I wanted it to work so bad. It's not weighted like you would think. It slides around, the hook thing is a joke. If you put it in the freezer, it stays cold/cool for about 10 minutes. You can't microwave it. Oh well"
My expectations were not met for the price. It is just a soft long length of fabric with pocket of beans in it. Had I been aware I would not have purchased it at the price I paid 2 months ago. The  product and materials used do not match the price for the description the product provides
"I can't sleep without a mask on.  The problem with these is you're supposed to lay on your side and they stay in place. However, it did not work like that for me. I found myself throughout the night searching for the mask and trying to stabilize🤪. I would not recommend them if you move a lot during your sleep."
"Not real excited with this. It's very light-weight, and I was looking for a noticeably weighty eye mask. This one really really doesn't feel much different than a basic one. The way is secures is extraordinarily uncomfortable. There's a huge lump in the back of your head. I just reast it over my eyes and don't secure it. Also the side that's velvety gets very hot"
"This product does keep the light out and is soft  but the little ""bean bags"" go all the way around to the side of my head causing me to lay in a lump. I tried to ignore it but it caused my neck to lift up off my pillow making my neck hurt. Will not use again."
The problem with this is that it's extremely light weight. I was expecting more weight since it's supposed to be weighted. It just feels like a black out mask. It's soft but just not weighted to really help. It feels like you just have a light blanket over your eyes.
Super comfortable but I guess not very well made and cheaply sewn together. The center seams have already busted after minimal use and the beads now shift creating uneven weight on either side.Super comfortable but for the price it should not already be falling apart.
I feel like this should be heavier. Sent it back
It's a great idea and it's soft but it's not heavy enough for me. I'm returning.
"This mask is very comfortable, the material is soft and the weight feels good, the problem is that the mask moves around. The manufacturer needs to modify the hole and strap insert method. I am returning it after a long night of attempts to keep the maks on."
The concept is great- quality is poor. The stitching let go after one use.
"I love the idea of tightening this around my head for headaches.  I did not like the pressure the ""pod"" put on my eyes.  This was just not comfortable for me."
"I bought this for my wife, it works great but only lasted  2months. She used it every night and it helped her sleep. But after the 2 months the seams separated and the beads fell out. Bummer."
Love to use this when I need to relax for 15 minutes or do.
"Hey! So I never leave reviews but I had to leave one for this product.Maybe you are a weirdo like me, but I consistently need some sort of weight on my forehead to sleep, and I often cannot sleep with lights in the room. For awhile, this was my forearm laid over my forehead, which made my arm fall asleep and didnt work all that well. But then I found this little nodpod! I have a lot to say so ill put it into pros and cons.Pros:-I love the dual sides for heat/cool. Living in texas it doesnt get cold really, but it's a nice option.-I use it almost every night! I love the weight of it and the little four pods, they fit my face perfectly.-Ive been using it for almost a year and it's held up really well, no tears or rips or anything like that.-As vain as it seems, I like that it doesnt look terribly dorky. I could use this on a plane and be fine with it.-I like that it can wrap around my head, and the little pods you dont use on the side of your head can be mini ""pillows"" if you are traveling.-I love that it's small and foldable, I can take it anywhere and it is easy to access!-works for back and side sleeping.Cons-Sadly, mine arrived damaged. There was a hole in between the two middle pods and the beads were moving in between. I sewed them shut and it works perfectly now, but it was frustrating at the time.-The fastening mechanism isnt very good. It tends to slide open and not stay tight around my head. In the mornings it might not still be on my eyes, which may defeat the purpose if youre looking to sleep in. To avoid this, I usually dont actually wrap it around my head, but lay it on my eyes and above me in a circle so I can manhandle it more, which actually has the added benefit of not requiring me to pick up my head if I need to put it on! Its easy to roll over, grab, and lay on my face if I ever forget to put it on before bed.All in all, if youre like me; traveler, dark sleeper, eye weight junkie, and lover of weird fun contraptions, I think this would be useful for you. Despite the drawbacks, I use it every night and I love it!! Some things can be improved but im willing to stick around to see what they do.Thanks for reading!Your friendly neighborhood sleeper ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ"
"I am a terrible sleeper, everything wakes me multiple times a night- even with a mask and earplugs. I was so intrigued by the weighted eyemask, but I am a stomach and side sleeper and didn't know if this would work.  My chiropractor wants me to stop sleeping on my stomach totally, and avoid side  sleeping, as I hunch my shoulders while sleeping causing tension during the day. So you have the background...Here is my breakdown review:5 stars- the weight is wonderful. When I put it on my eyes, it was perfect to relax me and make me feel ready to sleep. It stayed on, did not need to be adjusted during the night for the most part.  This I loved. It is super soft as well and comfortable overall.3-stars- when I rolled onto my side, it initially felt like I was sleeping on something (I was--the weight!) but I woke up still sleeping on my side and I did not bother me after I got past the initial difference.  3 stars because this could be an issue for a side sleeper but I think for me, the adjustment was very quick. This is the only reason I gave ""comfort"" 3 stars. If you are a back sleeper, give this 5 stars.1-star- this is not for a stomach sleeper, there was no way I could sleep at all with the way the weights were placed under the side of my head.  Also 1-star for price.  While initially I did not balk at the price, I think it is 25% more money than it should be. If it turns me into a back sleeper and eliminates the tension issues I have, then it would be worth much more than the price!Overall, not sure if I will keep this or not but going to give it a week or so, and see if I adjust my sleeping position.  I would recommend this to the majority of people, as I feel it would work for most.  I plan to update my review after a week or so of use."
The weight feels good and there are two sides with different textures which is nice. But it doesn't really help with sleeping. Three people in my house agree. Feels good but doesn't put you to sleep. Good for just relaxation.
I love everything about this product I just wish it was a tiny bit heavier as it is replacing a heavy feather pillow that I had on my head or face before that . This is definitely an upgrade and I have gotten used to it I recommend get a bright color as I keep losing the black one
"I work nights, so I've been trying different masks to block out the sun and this is the best one so far. The only issue I have is that it doesn't actually help with headaches... when I use it with a headache it feels too heavy on my eyes."
For the price I was a little disappointed that it arrived smelling like someone's greasy hair and there were white hairs on it (my hair ain't white lol). I'm assuming it was used and returned. It really wasn't worth going through the return process for me… so I just threw it in the washer and it came out perfectly fine! It does stay in place IF you are a still sleeper and the weight is perfect. They could definitely improve it with velcro or some sort of button to keep it in place. I had a migraine yesterday and the pressure helped a lot so I decided to write a review and say it is definitely worth the buy despite its few downsides.
"This works so much better than I anticipated! I thought it would annoy me and flop around everywhere but I like this design so much more than my old elastic one. My one complaint is that it's not great in bright rooms. It completely blocks out your surroundings, but direct light can still go through the oat-colored fabric. Maybe with the darker colors it isn't a problem?"
"I love my Nodpod. I'm obsessed with it and cannot sleep without it. I'm a side sleeper and sleep with the pods on my eyes and one ear, which blocks out all light and muffles sounds. My husband likes to borrow it when he takes naps, which triggers me because I'm so weirdly attached to it. I finally ordered him one at 2am when he stole it from me, claiming a headache. The bead pressure does help with that.I didn't give it 5 stars because the velvet side is scratchy on my eyelids, and I never use it. The fabric is very durable, but I'd prefer if it were a little softer. I wish the ""cool"" side was made of slippery fabric, like a nice stretchy satin."
I really like this sleep mask! I used to have to sleep with my arm or a pillow over my eyes but this completely solves that issue. There's a small slit in one side so you can try to wrap it around your head but it doesn't lay greatly but can still be tight enough to block out daylight. Worth the buy in my opinion
"I literally have a drawer full of sleeping masks that I've been experimenting with over the last few years. This is by far the greatest sleeping mask I've ever used in my life. My husband sleeps with a black sock over his eyes and has always done that as long as I've known him. I begrudgingly let him use my mask last night, And he wakes up and tells me it was the best mask he's ever used. So now he's going to be buying one as well. I think what really sets this mask apart from all the others is the fact that you don't have to tie it around your head because the weight of the beads makes it stay  Pretty consistently on your face even though I move frequently throughout the night. Also, the beds sink lower into my eyesocket, keeping my eyelids shut with very gentle pressure and prevent any light from entering my husband and I were both concerned that it might be a little hot, but neither one of us noticed any temperature difference between this mask, and our usual apparatus. My only problem with this mask is that they don't have the black color available via prime and I would have to wait for a long time for it. So I have a color I'm not exactly stoked about but damn if this isn't the greatest invention ever!"
"This is my second of these sleep masks (first one got lost), I love that they block out light and some sound, I really like the feeling of my head wrapped, and it's very soft and the perfect weight."
"Product is good quality. I use this to cover my eyes for sleeping with hopes that it will help my dry eye. Color was true to picture.  The only thing I was not happy about after giving Amazon a order over the amount required, I was still charged shipping fees for this product!!!"
Just what I was looking for. Not to heavy and long enough to sleep on side.
I've had this for about 3 months and can't imagine sleeping without it. The most restful sleep I've gotten in years!
"This is my second NodPod.  I now own two. I can't sleep without my NodPod.  I now own two because I hate to be without them. (one to wash, one to wear as it were) They have become the equivalent of a security blanket for my head. I have suffered from migraines since childhood. The search for any relief is an ongoing quest in the life of a chronic migraineur. I bought my first NodPod because I thought what could it possibly hurt to try? I am so glad I did. I am amazed that the four little weighted areas are so perfectly balanced as to give my eyes and my head the comfort I seem to need to find relief during sleep and the throes of an excruciating migraine.The NodPod is perfect for blocking out light, it moves with me, there is no constricting around my head like there is with other eye covers and it blocks out all light while giving me that perfect balanced pressure that I seek to have on my eyes and head during a migraine. It can be put in the freezer without becoming as hard as a rock, although I just choose the ""cool side"" and it is comfortable enough for me. If I want it colder: (I put it in a freezer bag to keep it from picking up the smell of the freezer) I will put it in the freezer for a couple of hours. Also: DO NOT PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE. IT WILL MELT.Other migraineurs have asked me for my opinion or recommendations for this product, so here it is. Remember, however, that every person is different and responds differently to stimuli. This may be perfect for you, or you may have to seek something that works better for you. This is just my opinion, based on my experience. From my experience, this is an excellent product, well constructed, thought out, and useful for me."
I love this mask. It's replaced all others!Pros:-comfortable-sleeping faster-cute color-softCons:-for me it has to be tied to stay on-can be tricky to put awayStill 10/10 recommend
"I was a little worried how well this eye mask would work for me given it's unconventional nature. The first night was a little tricky getting used to it, but now I sleep better than I have in a long time! The weight feels so good and comforting. The fact that it doesn't stay on if you toss around isn't a real issue because you can easily put it back on and fall right to sleep."
I've used weighted blankets before and loved but it's too hot to use year-round. This was so comfortable and soothing. I love that you don't have a strap around your head and can adjust comfortably as you move during sleep without laying on a strap fastener which is very annoying. This and some magnesium ZzzzZ. Even if you use this for a nap or meditation practice-I recommend!
"I was contemplating putting black on film on all 5 of my bedroom windows. I have sleep issues and thought darkness would help. Read reviews on this mask, ordered it: I LOVE IT. I have slept so soundly. I don't toss and turn anymore. But if I roll over, it's very easy to adjust this.Recommend to anyone wanting a better night sleep."
"I always use an eye mask, shirt, or something else to cover my eyes at night. I've tried those eye masks with beads or gel in them but they always seem to smell weird or be uncomfortable. I love my weighted blanket and love this item just as much. I didn't know I need it until I saw it and tried it and I can't imagine going without it now. It's just the right amount of weight, it's easy to position and it works weight I'm lying on my back or on my side. I was skeptical of the design (it doesn't wrap around your head) until I tried it. It's more comfortable tbh than the traditional mask straps that go around your head.If you like eye masks and/or weighted blankets this is awesome."
Perfect for naps to block light .  The weight feels comforting on the eyes without pushing too hard.  Soft and pliable to get exactly as you want it.  I love this!
"Have tried numerous night masks ,ending up with my hair on the back of my head breaking.This mask although a lot pricey was worth the purchase. I constantly change positions and it seems to stay on with out any elastic or Velcro closures allowing fir a good night's sleep."
"I am a snob when it comes to sleeping with eye masks. I cannot fall asleep with any light and have been sleeping with a mask for years. Nothing comes close to this one, it is hands down the best, most comfortable total light blocker and I cannot live without it now that I've tried it. I've never slept so well!I've tried every type and every brand of eye masks and I hate the elastic bands and the fact there is always light leaking through somewhere. Eventually I settled on old cut up shirts over my eyes. Which is actually quite similar to this but the bean bags allow it to comfortably settle on my eye blocking ALL light!!!I thought it was a bit pricey but now that I've been using it, it's worth way more to me than what I paid for.I'm beyond happy to find this eye mask!"
"This eye mask is worth every penny! The weight is just perfect to keep my eyes relaxed and shut. The cooling fabric on one side keeps me from getting the ""sticky eyes"" from moisture and sweating, and I love the length so you can tighten it around your head or let it lay loose and still be able to roll from side to side.  Last but not least, the introduction booklet that comes with the packaging is fun and witty. This has quickly become a beloved staple. I will be purchasing more of these for friends, family and self!"
"I've been working 3rd shift for about 4 years now.. Lately I've been having issues sleeping and so I figured the room was too bright and started looking into eye masks. Now the issue I kept struggling with is I do move in my sleep and I don't want to feel ""trapped"" with an eye mask on my head if that makes sense. I like that this one lays on your face and is semi weighted with beads to stay in place and provide some benefits of weighted relief. Now it doesn't stay on your face all of your sleeping time obviously however there is a hole where you can play a corner in to affix it to your head. I like that it helps me sleep and if I wake up later it's next to me ready to place on my face again. The jersey side is my favorite side the other side is a fuzzy soft material my husband likes (yup bought him one too because he stole mine while sleeping one night) you can even FREEZE this lovely thing for headache days oh my goodness. (CANNOT heat this item due to the beads) I love literally love this sleep mask it really has helped treat this horrible bout of unable to sleep and stay asleep issues I've been having."
"I've slept with a satin eye mask for past year and always annoyed when I would wake up and it slide off my head and it's so tiny I could never find it in middle of night. The nodpod has really been amazing, at first I was skeptical like how it doesn't go around your head. But after reading instructions on when you're on your side how to place it vs back, I'm obsessed!! The gentle pressure really helps put me to sleep. And then in middle of night if I wake up and it's off me (I move a lot in my sleep) because of it's shape it's so easy to find vs a small regular eye mask. Also it's so cozy sometimes I wake up finding myself cuddling it like a stuffed animal haha. I love it and def gonna buy a second one for my husband !"
"Perfect weight- it's comfy when you first lay it down, but give it a couple of minutes and it melts to your face and provides so much relaxation. It's soft, comfortable, and stays on my face without leaving those awful sleep mask hair dents. Can't sleep without it now! I also started using it in the afternoons when I take a break from work (I'm a remote worker.) right around 2-3p I started doing these 20 minute meditation breaks where I put my feet up and close my eyes, and just relax and not think about work. The nodpod has helped SO MUCH in allowing me to really zone in and be mindful. LOVE IT"
"I love this nodpod, I use it every night! I do wish I had the option of one that is even lighter because sometimes when it is resting against my eyeballs it can be uncomfortable. The shape of the little pouches can be smoothed over your face so it's less uncomfortable, but sometimes the beads shift so they're like all in your eye sockets and weighing them down. So maybe if the little sections were even flatter? Obviously it takes a few tries to figure out how it is comfortable but I still love it"
"I honestly feel like since getting this, I fall asleep much faster. The gentle pressure on my eyes must signal to my brain that its night-night time. I tend to shift to my side throughout the night and sometimes it does fall off, but its not too big a deal for me. My bedroom gets extremely bright in the morning and it blocks out all of that light. I recommend! The duo sided textures are also a nice feature."
Only concern is that it feels like you're sleeping on a knot. Otherwise the weight distribution is good and I like the coolness of the mask on my eyes.
Satisfied with mask but had to take the seeds out of the left side as I am a side sleeper only.
I like the material and the weight of it. The only bad thing is. That it doesn't stay on your head over night.
"Wish it was heavier, but it is comfortzble."
Slips off as you sleep. Would a little velcro kill anyone?
It takes some getting used to but it keeps the light out.
Love this mask ... feels good and works great!
Very soft and comfortable but it loosens up because the fabric tab for holding it together doesn't stay tight.
Very comfortable
Works well but falls off
"When I first found the Nod Pod, I did t get the hype. Now I have two and I truly can't sleep without it. I love this product so so much. It truly is life changing. If you are struggle with chronic migraines or just sleep insomnia, get this. You won't regret it."
Amazing product for travel!
"Love my Nodpod! When I place this wonderous little pillow over my eyes for a few minutes, I feel calmer and more relaxed. Plus, both sides are very soft and the sage color is beautiful. I had this in my cart for a few weeks, and I'm happy I snapped it up on prime day. This would make a great gift too!"
I saw this product on TikTok and was totally influenced to buy it. I have no regrets! I fall asleep so quick with this thing and I absolutely love putting it in the freezer to use when I have a headache. I also like that it has a cool side and a warm side based on the fabric so I have options. My favorite thing about this mask is that it falls off in the middle of the night if you don't tie it so you don't wake up confused or uncomfortable if that makes sense! It completely blocks light unlike a lot of sleep masks which is also a plus!
This product was recommended by a friend too with dry eyes. This item provides a soothing sleepYou will enjoy
I fall asleep much faster than I used to. I love the fact that I can put it in the freezer. The weight is perfect for me and it blackens out all of the light.
"Recently started struggling with sleep due to increased light sensitivity and sleep masks never fit over the bridge of my nose well enough to block out light. Dug out the Nodpod I got years ago as a birthday gift and fell in love. It's PERFECT. It conforms to my eyes and the shape of my nose so well, it's like a blackout curtain for my face. I love that I can move it around in the night and adjust it as needed, opposed to sleep masks which really have just one setting. I started sharing it with my husband for mornings I needed to turn on the light but didn't want to wake him up, and on a recent long haul flight (love that it loops thru itself so it can be used sitting up). He loved it as much as I did, so of course I had to buy him his own. Sharing is caring but love is buying your partner their own Nodpod!"
"This product should be at the top of your list if you are looking for a sleep mask. It is comfortable but also helps with mild migraines and sinus issues when I need to nap during the day. The light blocking was the main reason I got this, but the added benefits and deeper sleep I get make this a top product."
"Love love love this lil thing! The packaging is super cheeky, and the product itself does exactly what I want! It has the perfect weight and helps me fall asleep fast! I love that I can wear it loose (fall off while I'm snoozing) or tighten it to stay on all night! And the cold side really does feel chilled (fav side)! Only negative, isn't really a big deal but some stitching between ""pods"" (?) came lose and beads will go back and forth between the two, some times leaving one pod full and the other completely empty. Normally I just redistribute them before I fall asleep. Nothing an extra stitch won't fix. 10/10 will DEFINITELY buy again. Also PERFECT for travel! (I've had it 6mths, won't ever survive without it now)"
"Entrega a tiempo. . Es maravilloso, descanso mejor, es confortable, me siento libre. No estropea mi pelo."
"I recently had a bad concussion, and all light bothered me. Even keeping my bedroom door closed and my curtains pulled tight, the light from computers, chargers, night lights, etc. still hurt. I finally got one of these after borrowing, my wife's for a few nights, and it made all of the difference. The pressure from the weight on my eyes made most of the pain go away, and they literally block every bit of light so I was able to get some good rest. I don't use it as often now, but maybe 1 or 2 nights a week I will put it on.I almost forgot, but I am a big time side sleeper, and this does not slip off if you sleep on your side. Of 8 hours of sleep, I'm on my right side 6 hours and left side most of the rest, and it has not come off at all."
block out light when you don't have another pillow to cover your face with
"I was afraid this mask would feel too heavy on my eyes, because I'm pretty sensitive. It does not feel too heavy at all. It seems to gradually add slight pressure I assume as gravity takes hold. Extremely comfortable. I don't like traditional eye masks and the way they go around your head, scrunching up you hair. Plus I can always feel them on the back of my head. This mask eliminates these issues. Fits great and blocks out all light. Quicker and easier to remove than a traditional eye mask. I've used it while sleeping on my side and it works just as well as when sleeping on my back. Very comfortable. Highly recommend."
"It's quite effective…comfy and dark…light does not sneak in…the downside is that you sleep longer, as the morning light no longer awakens you…so not so good if you need/want to get up early…"
"I liked the material, no fragrance from the materials and the weight on my eyes. It's relaxing to use it."
"Hands down responsible for the best sleep of my life. At this point we buy them constantly for everyone in our lives. Great design, perfect weight and so soothing. I move around a lot at night and the strap does a great job of keeping the nodpods snug and in place. Highly recommend to anyone struggling with going to sleep. I've used different colors and they all do a great job with blocking out the light, but for complete and total darkness, get the black ones. For summer or when you have a migraine or headache, pop them in the freezer and they will work wonders."
"Love this thing! It helps me fall asleep right away and sleep well. My dreams are more vivid since using my nod pod. I'm not sure if those are related, but it's something I've noticed."
The design is great! Works for side sleepers and keeps my curls from getting messed up by having to tie a strap.
"I have used many sleep masks. This is the best one ever.  Light weight, doesn't squash your eyes, washable, and helps with headaches."
"I got one for me and my boyfriend was always using it, so I got one for him too. Perfect fabric choices and weight. I like the fact you can use it without having the lock around your head."
I've been on a mission to find a sleep mask that I like. I saw this in an article and didn't do a lot of research. I was surprised that it is just one strip. That said when I found the loop hole on the end it made all the difference in the world. I love this thing. It stays in place while I sleep.
I love the quality of this sleep mask. So comfortable and actually works for a good nights rest!
"Love this product.  Although it has a small button hole in the back, there was no actual button.  The 1st week I just laid it over my eyes, but of course when you turn over it falls off.  So I added a button and it stayed on perfectly after that!"
Sometimes I wish it didn't have so many weighted pods - but overall I like it.  I am using it every night though.  I am glad I have it and I do feel it helps me sleep better.
"I don't like the tension of normal eye masks that use an elastic band, these are easy to fall asleep in because they are so comfortable, but obviously they shift and fall off during the night.  if you only need a mask to fall asleep (not stay asleep) I would recommend."
I use this often and have no issue with the comfort. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is that it does not completely block out light. It might be due to the orange color I ordered. Perhaps a darker color would be better.
"I wish they were a little heavier, I like the pressure of having my arm over my eyes and this isn't that, it's much less. Otherwise I really like them. The cool side is actually cool too!"
"This seems like a super great product, but the instruction packet and the box itself have sexual insinuations on them. Taglines like ""before we sleep together..."", ""can't wait to sleep with you"", and ""don't worry, I'll fit"" - nothing worse than that. I would laugh it off myself BUT this is a gift for my nap-loving boyfriend, and we are celibate for religious purposes and it's gonna add a bit of awkward laughter to the whole thing. Currently trying to find some good sized stickers that could craftily block key phrases. Again, the product seems awesome but this is your warning about the packaging for any young, old, or celibate audiences."
"Loved this item, I do think it would work best for folks who sleep on thier back though, I'm a fidgety side-sleeper so it kept needing adjustment. Very good weight and lovely soft feel too, would recommended trying"
"I love a weighted blanket I had andThis had good reviews in a magazine I got recently so I thought I'd try it for my dry eyes that need protection from the air of my Cpap. It coversMore than enough to prevent the sore fromMy Cpap and is super soft.  I do wish it fastened around the head Another way then the buttonhole, so it doesn't come lose and isn't so bunched behind the head. SimpleElastic or Velcro or even adjustable strap would be more comfortable. Still worked well and got a good nights sleep the past two nights."
"Love this next to any traditional eye mask. I would prefer it to be heavier, but it's good. The one thing I dislike most is that the beads (obviously) shift around due to gravity.. not sure what I expected because I guess they'd all do that, but I just manipulate the beads into the right spot when I get comfy in my bed. Overall I love it & I'd recommend it to anyone"
Helps me fall asleep neat lil invention
"I bought this initially looking for a weighted eye mask option and although its not very ""heavy"", it does the trick. Stays on all night for me when I hook the ends together. More frequently I rest it on my face and that option totally works too!"
I liked the weight of this and the materialI get bad migraines.  This did not cure them but it helped to calmThem down.
"I really like this product.  It's comfortable, not too heavy and adjustable.The slit in one of the sides helps to keep it in place."
"Overall, it's a great sleep mask. The only thing I don't like is that it's still slightly too big when I pull it as tight as it will go. The weight is great though! I keep mine in the freezer before use and it's nice and cool as well."
"Our family have migraine headaches frequently. I purchased two of these to use specifically for those blinding headaches. We have used many items, including prescriptions, but this is an added comfort item.  It seems like a weird little product but it absolutely helps in easing discomfort"
"I really like this. When I'm super stressed is nice to just lay down with my eyes closed and having this nod pod on my eyes is very relaxing. I was surprised by its weight. It is not very heavy at all. At first I thought that would make me like it less, but it still makes me feel relaxed"
"This helps me calm down and actually keep my eyes closed when I have trouble settling to sleep! I actually wish it had a little more weight to help with migraines, and you really have to lie on your back so side sleeping it's not as effective. I would still buy it again though, I'm definitely enjoying it."
Love this product. Great for headaches and migraines.  Though doesnt stay cold for long out of the freezer.
I love mine so much that I have purchased two more for friends as gifts. The Nodpod has made a huge difference in my ability to fall asleep. I have slept with it every night since I got it. Highly recommend.
"I sleep so good with this weighted eye mask the best, I will never sleep without this!"
I have a lot of trouble sleeping and this has helped immensely.
I LOVE this mask!! It lets me shut out the world and helps me have a deeper sleep. The weight of the beads inside the mask give my eye area a gentle pressure that helps me relax. And you can secure it in back of your head so you can sleep on your side/ stomach without the mask sliding off. I highly recommend this sleep mask!! The best there is.
"A friend of mine recommended the NodPod for better sleep. She showed me hers and I thought, ""Why would this silly thing work?"" I ordered it any way…..oh my….I have never slept so well in my life. Do set an alarm because you don't wake up for anything!"
The pressure from this soft mask is perfect. I used to wake up 10x a night and to go back to sleep I would put a pillow over my head for pressure but would wake up with neck pain because of the awkward position the pillow put my neck in. I've only slept with this mask twice thus far. It didn't slip off or turn my hair into a birds nest.
"I love this product - I'll probably continue ordering these for the rest of my life if there is ever wear and tear on the one I bought!I bought this in an effort to help with anxious rumination at nighttime. I would often find myself up late, thinking about the next day's problems with my eyes open! I wouldn't even realize my eyes were open since the room was dark, but it was a common occurrence. I wanted to try something to block my vision at night and randomly stumbled across this product while looking at sleep masks. The concept of a weighted mask intrigued me, so I purchased thinking I might return them but now I rarely sleep without this.Pros:- the weight in the little ""pods"" are perfect. Takes a few moments to get used to, then feels like a gentle comfortable pressure.- the texture of the fabric is different on both sides, so you can pick if you want the warmer sort of fuzzy side or the cool cotton.-You really can sleep however you want with these on - I'm a side and back sleeper and I move throughout the night but this can be oriented any way that I want without issue. I usually drape it over my face and at some point in the night it does slide off but I've fallen asleep peacefully by then!Cons:- this has a built in hole and slot system so you can sit up and wear it (for travel, I think) but this mechanism doesn't feel super secure with the weight of the pods. I haven't really tested it out much but it may be a bit awkward- expensive for an eye mask, but you really get what you pay for and its well worth the money!"
I am loving this! The light weight on the eyes is very relaxing and it blocks the light better than any eye mask I've ever tried. I'm buying another one!
"I used to put a pillow over my head to sleep and had to wrestle with it all night long. I also had to sleep at the top of the bed so I could leverage the pillow on the headboard. It's the perfect weight and size, easy to move as I move through out the night, and super easy to take with me anywhere!"
I bought it because of the positive reviews. I was afraid it would fall off my eyes but the beads help it stay in place.I'm a fan!!Edit to add now that I've had it several weeks….this is one of my favorite things I own. Just bought a second to keep in my suitcase as I travel often.Highly recommend the Nodpod!!
"Tbh I bought this as a gag gift for myself... No way this was going to work as a ""real"" sleep mask, I thought. I love sleep masks and I have quite the collection, from the cheap ones the airline companies give you to the ones with silk and all the gimmicks and designs for light blocking and comfort.I was more interested in the weighted aspect of this one as I once used a weighted blanket and I loved the feeling of calm/security it gives.Well, well, well... the joke is on me! I love this eye patch and will not be without it. It is true that is is easier to use if you are used to sleeping on you back, as it simply doesn't move. I fell asleep without even realizing it the first time I used it, ""just to try"". It blocks out the light even in a bright room.I am, however, a side sleeper and I sleep on both sides. The flat, end tail of the mask makes this very possible and much more confortable than expected. The other pods that are not in use lay on the side of your head and the weight really feels good and relaxing. The only issue, if I must point one out, is that you have to adjust the pods on your eyes if you change sides a lot but now I do this almost automatically without waking up too much. Apparently you can join the ends together somehow but I haven't tried that yet.Anyways, I love this thing more than expected and will be getting one for my Dad who shares my ridiculous obsession for eyepatches!"
"Not only is my room pitch black, but I'm liking the heavy feel of this product .. think weighted blanket helping some people sleep."
"I've used it every night since it arrived. Helps me fall asleep. It's easy to wash, I toss it in with a load of bedding with similar washing instructions. As a hot sleeper, I love the cool side. The other side is very soft and cozy."
"Woah, I'm a late night sleeper and because of my bad habit I never get good sleep. This thing got me sleeping nice and deep. I naturally woke up 6 hours later wearing this to my surprise feeling so rested and ready to wake up. Hopefully it'll help me to change my habit to going to sleep earlier, since it knocks me to sleep pretty fast :)"
"I was so excited to sleep with this mask it's so pretty and it's very soft it also matches the aesthetic of my room. But the first night I got it I slept with it, when I woke up the next morning I had blurred vision like it was so bad I could barely see big objects let alone read anything on my phone. When I tell you how scary this was… I cried!! After about 2 hours my vision started to go back to normal..and I just had a headache btw I have always had perfect vision like I can read a label from across the room good so I personally won't ever be using this again.it's obviously way to heavy set for eyes and unsafe. I'm considering returning it or taking the beads out but this for almost $40! I was so surprised.. you would think your getting the best quality. But I just thought I would share my terrifying experience so that whoever reads this can be warned and prepared. My vision is back to normal but that's not something worth risking again or playing with."
"I have always had a hard time falling asleep at night, but this helps me within minutes drift off. I am a side sleeper, so I love that you can place it perfectly on your head/eyes without it bulging behind your head or feeling lumpy. Definitely worth every penny!!!!"
"I wasn't too sure about it at first, but after having slept several weeks with this eye pillow, it's fantastic. Soft, a gentle weight, and it does a good job at blocking light. It does well for the initial fall asleep stage of side sleeping as well. Of course, I'm an active sleeper so it does roll off my face, but that doesn't bother me."
Simplicity form and function using gravity to creat black out conditions.  Highly recommend it. My head sweats easily and any mask would get too hot or tight or too worn out. It's like a mini blanket for your eyes that stays it place. Now I can sleep in any light conditions knowing I can black out any time. Highly recommend it.☺️
This sleep mask is super soft and comfy. Easy to travel with. I use it at home now too. It seems to signal my brain that it's time to sleep. Would 100% buy again.
"I was looking for a new one because my silk eye mask was just getting way too hot on my eyes. A bit skeptical at first, I discovered that this mask works well and doesn't get hot when using the cooling side."
"I waited a little to give this an honest review to make sure it wasn't just a coincidence that I've been able to fall asleep faster lately. I've suffered from insomnia for most of my life so and so postpartum insomnia takes it to a new level and sleep is already hard to come by. I can't take sleep aids as they make me groggy and right now, I'm still waking with the little one numerous times a night. I've always had luck drifting off if I put a heavy pillow over my ear (I'm a side sleeper) but it also hot and makes it so hard to hear the baby because it drowns out so much sound. Not sure if it's the weight, darkness or noise cancelation that the pillow provided but it's not an option when I need to wake and tend to the baby. THIS product is lighter but still heavy enough to provide the weight, noise cancellation and darkness I need to drift off quickly and ""sleep when the baby sleeps"" but still hear the baby when needed. It's also has a surprising cooling effect. For me, it's definitely takes more than 3 the minutes to drift off as advertised, but it's better than not sleeping. I love the length of the weighted section so that I can drape over my ear for noise cancelation when on my back or side sleeping. I also love that it's not one that you have to have an elastic band around your head to secure. I'm so glad I found this and absolutely find it worth the money."
"I had surgery early this year to fix my droopy eye lid.  The unintended result of the surgery is that there was a bit of overcorrection, so now my left eye where I had the surgery doesn't close all the way when i sleep.  This causes my eye to dry out and be really painful in the morning.  I had to start using eyeball cream at night which helped, but not 100%.  I needed something to help keep my eye closed at night, and this does just that.  It's not too heavy so it's not uncomfortable, but just enough weight to keep my eye lid closed.  This has definitely helped my eye dryness and pain to now it is almost non-existent."
"I love this product. I can't go anywhere without it. I bought two to have when the other is in the wash.I did notice that the weight isn't consistent though. One weighed lighter than the other but it didn't affect how quickly I was able to fall asleep with it on.  I love that it's designed so you can use it even when sleeping on your sides. It's so nice to be able to block light out completely with it on.I brought it on a trip and got stopped by TSA though. I'd recommend keeping it in the tube it comes in so you can show the security guards that it's an actual product. I'd be devastated if they ruined it by cutting into it.The other thing I noticed since I started using it was that I started getting really bad and dark bags under my eyes. Not sure if it's related but it was just something I noticed. I've never been the type to get eye bags before so it was questionable for me. I just chalked it up to ""it could be anything"". Despite this, I'm still using the mask every night. I haven't found a better product that helps me fall asleep this quickly - under three minutes! Anyway, I thought I should mention it in case anyone else is experiencing the same thing."
"I love this mask so much, it's by far the best one I've tried. I want it pitch black when I'm falling asleep and the coverage is great. The weight of it feels so cool and comfortable on the eyes and I fall asleep just like that. I like not having to wrap it around my head but I will say that I have to search my bed to find it in the morning if you're a sleeper who moves around a lot like me"
"This is a really great sleep mask. Not too heavy on the eyes, soft material, and no annoying elastic band around my head. And it shuts out the light. This was great for sleeping in the daytime after night shifts, and still great for sleeping at night with my day shifts."
"Love this thing! I've taken Nod Pod to Paris, Lisbon, Barcelona and London. Don't want to sleep without it. Zero light gets in and it feels good. I add a few drops of essential oil to it three times a week and it's great. Works equally well for sleeping on your side or flat on your back. You just need to position it a  bit different for each. Use the middle two for supine and either end for side sleeping where you rap the triangle end around your head. I feel I sleep better due to it. Great purchase!"
"If you like sleeping with an eye mask these Nod Pods are hard to beat! They last forever, extremely comfortable, & don't tangle around your neck when you wake up in the morning. I throw me & my gf's in the washer with our bed sheets & good to go!"
I asked my bf for a nodpod for xmas last year - he ended up stealing it from me because it's so great and I had to buy him his own.  The design is really really excellent.  The pods are like little beanbags and they settle onto your eyes so nicely and aren't too heavy.  I like how they are shaped in such a way that they don't put a bunch of pressure on your nose.  It does a great job of keeping light out.  It's great for side-sleepers because you don't have to tie it - the weight of the pods keeps it in place well enough if you just lay it across your face.  If you want to tie it around your head - there is a slit on one tail that you are meant to pull the other through to sort of cinch it around your head.  I've found that the slit is kinda small and it makes it hard to shove the other tail through BUT the tightness means it doesn't come undone.  I recommend nodpods all the time!
"My fiance and I just moved into a new place, and our bedroom window unfortunately faces a streetlight. We both aren't fond of curtains, and as someone who needs pitch black to sleep, I sucked it up and bought an eye mask. I've never really been a fan of eye masks, so I did some research and this one appealed to me. And... y'all. I got the best sleep of my life. It was so comfortable, especially since I'm a side sleeper, and even though I'm actively sick, I fell right asleep (especially when coupled with some storm sounds). I've told all of my friends to buy it 😂"
"I previously bought one of those sleep mask with velcro that goes around your head, but it stretched out and I have a small head.  This is so much better.  I love the weight of it.  It doesn't slide off unless you toss and turn a lot.  It blocks light and has a warm and cool side. It's not itchy or annoying to me like the other types I've tried."
"I got this with the intention of wearing it when i get migraines, as the pressure over my eyes and forehead helps reduce the pain a lot. im so glad i got this! Its not scented which is good as scents bother me when i get migraines and it does a great job at blocking out light (both for sleep and light sensitivity with migraines) This thing is so soft and the weight is perfect on the eyelids, this will definitely be coming with me on vacations. I only took a star away because i assumed this could be microwavable (if they do make a microwave safe one i WILL be buying!) otherwise it can be put in the freezer to keep extra cool. I did notice that it doesn't get hot/too warm when you wear it, the fabric keeps it cool as you wear it. If you're thinking about getting this for yourself, or as a gift, its very worth it!! Highly recommend this. Also i love all the color variations, i have the color Wisteria"
I suffer from bouts of insomnia as well as migraine attacks. I've been using this product for months now and I fall asleep so much faster because of it. I'm a side sleeper and definitely can attest to this being the comfiest sleep mask I've tried. The beads haven't stayed evenly dispersed though - I can work around it but I think the stitching quality needs to be looked into. Overall a great product and I'm happy to have found it!
"The mask is comfortable and definitely helped me fall asleep. I did not pull it through the loop to secure, I just laid it on my face. I haven't really seen a product like this before, I can understand the frustration for someone looking for a more traditional sleep mask, but this isn't that, and for what it is, it's nice.It was super comfortable when I was laying on my side, I actually preferred how it felt then!"
"I was looking for a weighted mask that would block out the ambient light and that I could comfortably wear along with my CPAP mask.  This Nodpod sleep mask meets my needs.  I really like it!!  It is soft and comfortable.  I wear it across my eyes without closing the back, and it stays on.  Personal tweaks I would made are adding a little more weight, and making it a little more narrow.  I highly recommend this."
"I saw this product on Good Morning America and immediately ordered it. I've always insomnia no matter if I worked days or night. I'm currently working night shift, and only manage to sleep a few hours at a time. I tried the NodPod the day it arrived - I managed to sleep soundly for nearly 7 hours and felt completely rested for the time in a long while. The product stayed in place-as I usually sleep on my back and wind up on a side-it stayed in place. The light pressure felt great and was relaxing-the microbeads DID NOT shift around as some have complained. I'm going to order a second NodPod to keep in a travel bag so I will never forget it. I've been using it for the past 5 days and it has helped me get the best sleep I've had in a long while."
"To start off I'm a side sleeper. For years I've been using an old T-shirt and after 11 years it's starting to fall apart. So the search for a sleeping mask began. I've had it for about two weeks now and I can say I really love it! After slipping the end into the slot, the mask stays on my face throughout the night. I was worried about the weight of the beads since all I've ever had was a T-shirt but it's the right amount of pressure on my eyes. Helps me fall asleep a lot faster as well. Since there are beads inside they do shift around but not enough to make it uncomfortable or awkward at all."
"I really do like this and I find it way better than a mask. the only reason I gave it a 4 is because I wish it were slightly wider, (the pictures make it look wider than it actually is) and softer. I love the fact it blocks out the light, the weight is perfect and it's comfortable to wear when I sleep, especially if I am sleeping on my side or stomach."
"First, I wrapped it around my shoulders and neck and think it relaxed me there. I had never seen anything like this. I gave it a try last night. I believe it helped me go to sleep faster and I awakened feeling rested. I will try again tonight."
Beware that I found it difficult to use comfortably cause I sllep on sides. If back sleeper it may be enjoyed more.
"I bought grey, as a gift, and the person received it in black."
"I work nights and have to sleep during the day. I needed something to block out the daytime light. I wasn't sure how well I was going to like this but, after a week I love it."
The seams were not tight so beads fall into the end panel annoying poor quality
Very soft and just the right weight to it. Good product.
"Helps block out light and noise by covering eyes and ears.What I do not like is the weight it puts on my eyes in one position.Flip it over and it does not put as much weight on the eyelids.Some people may like the weight, I do not.I use it daily with good success."
"I like this sleeping aid. It is comfortable, once you get it on properly. However, it does bunch up a bit in the back, so I didn't give it the highest rating. I do believe though that I am getting a better, deeper sleep using this."
"The mask is fine, however it has like beads inside so it's not ""weighted"" feels like a bean bag. So I would call it a weighted eyemask. I wish it was heavier on my face."
I bought this for my husband who struggles some nights when I'm reading later than he is.  He finds the NodPod quite relaxing but a little bit warm on the face.  I suggested he use the other side; maybe the sides are different for that reason.
"Helpful for falling asleep, works its way down over the course of the night - suggestion . . . do not wrap it around your head - just lay it on the eyes"
"Best sleep my husband has had in ages.  The first night, he actually overslept.  My only complaint was that I order it in the grey color and was sent bright pink which was not the best"
"I like that it is a good weight, just right for comfort. But sine I run hot, I feel too hot with this mask on sometimes. It does help me to fall asleep faster."
It's okay
I really wanted to like this! Unfortunately I toss and turn too much for it to stay on. I was constantly adjusting it and taking it off in frustration.  I even used the cool side and it was still too warm for me. The concept is great and I can definitely see it being more helpful for less rowdy sleepers than me.
"I was expecting this to be nicer quality considering how expensive it is. I'm disappointed. It's no different than any other ""weighted"" sleep mask. I'd say save your money and get one of the less expensive ones. They're nicer. I can't get over how cheaply made this thing is and I paid $34 for it. I feel like a chump."
I use this on my forehead when I have a headache. I don't like the lumpiness on my eyes & it falls off too easily. I'll stick to my eye mask & buy something flat & heavy next time for my forehead.
It says gentle pressure but I still think it's a bit too heavy for my eyes.
"It doesn't stay put and keep my eyes covered, even when I use the loop to tuck in on end. I went back to my regular sleep mask."
Nice product. It's a tad smaller then I expected it to be... but buyer beware on the color Sedona. I expected this to be a tan/orange hue.  But it really looks more like a pink to me... in case your gifting this to a male. It's definitely reading more of a pink hue then tan or orange.
Sleep Guru Here -- Not sure how i feel about this one. don't use but sometimes find it a queue for sleep time. You follow me? like sometimes i'll drape this over and then boom it helps but most of the time indeed 13/14 days it won't be this product but my sleep is valuable so $ it's got its merits.
"I wish this had slightly more weight to it. As a frequent migraine sufferer, a bit more pressure would be better"
"It's ok, I left my Barmy one at a hotel and needed a replacement. This does the job, sort of. Doesn't block out ambient room light though and doesn't stay in place like my old one. Weight is very light. Def going back for another Barmy."
"I like it but it tends to feel heavy on my eyelids, which is purposeful. Meh."
"I was actually surprised by how light this mask is and thought it was funny that there are some reviewers who found it to heavy. I had a very heavy mask prior and wouldn't mind if this one had more weight. Regardless, this mask is very comfortable. I love the loop hole design in the back. It is not lumpy and doesn't catch your hair the way Velcro straps do. I love the length. It feels like my head and eyes are being given a fuzzy hug. Came nicely packaged as well."
Not heavy enough for me and why is there no button to close it?I pulled the fabric through the hole but then it was too small to go down over my ears where I need it.
"It's a decent product, seems to be made well. Comfortable, soft. I just don't get it. I love my weighted blanket, I feel secure and sleep better. But the nodpod pillow weighted blanket for your eyes thing has no effect on me.It's like a normal sleep mask, as mentioned before it's comfortable but isn't completely dark as you shift around if that matters to you. 4 stare for being a decent product but no difference in sleep quality."
"There are 4 sections of micro beads in this nodpod. The middle two are over your eyes and the outer two cover your ears if you wrap it and secure it around your head, which is want I wanted to do.  The pressure from the two middle sections on the eyes were great, but as a side sleeper, the beads in those outer sections were surprisingly hard against my ears making it completely uncomfortable and impossible to sleep with.  So, I used a seam ripper and took out the beads in the two outer sections.  Now, I can wrap it around my head and my ears are covered but without the hard beads. It doesn't block out sound, but that wasn't an issue for me.  I suppose you could refill it with polyfil or something to provide softness with a sound barrier.  Hope this helps!"
"I really wish I could find this construction but closer to a full pound of weight. It's the only one I've tried (I returned two back to Amazon before getting this one) that rests nicely on my face, stays in place, doesn't get stuck with my curly hair & hook n' loops, doesn't press into my nose causing me to feel suffocated.The material is super soft and the pockets aren't so packed tight like some other brands so it drapes easy and doesn't cause weird pressure points."
"I love nod pod, I have like 5 of them and can't sleep without it. The only thing is I ordered this purple one and it wasn't sewn correctly and the little beads in it goes all in one pocket so it isn't evenly spread out anymore. Unfortunately it makes it unusable because it's lumpy. All my others ones work though so I think it was just an issues with the sewing on this one."
"The mask is a little lighter than I expected, I have to manipulate the beads to keep the weight on my eye sockets, otherwise the length of the mask shifts the weight across the head .My doctor wanted me to sleep with weighted eye mask to keep my eyelids closed as I'm experiencing dry eye.  It's comfortable, and stays in place if i stay on my back. If I roll on my side it initially stays in place, but if I awake on my side it has slipped off.  I like the fact that I don't need a band around my head but It can be comfortably attached if you want. It can't be heated or chilled, so I must use another mask for warm/cold compresses."
"I often sleep with my arm over my eyes, so I figured I would try this instead. Pros: I liked the material used (it is cool on the side that you place against your eyes, which turned out to be a very nice feature). Cons: It actually isn't heavy enough for me. I wish they had put more microbeads in it. I can get a slightly better effect by moving all the beads to sit directly above my eyes, but it could still be heavier. You also have to sleep on your back and it will fall off if you roll. There is no way to secure it to your head. Will look for some microbead long stuffed animal - that should do the trick."
"I originally got this for my migraines, but have been using this at night when I sleep as well. I keep it looped and just slip it over my head then tighten it and it seems to work fine that way. The beads do tend to go one way if I lay that way, but I really just like this for how well it blocks any and all light out. I don't ever wake up in the middle of the night anymore. I get the best sleep with this mask on, especially when I have anxiety. I have only had one migraine since getting this and it seemed to work pretty well for it too! I definitely recommend it to everyone!!"
"I have only used this two nights so far, but I'd say there's nothing magic about it. It's ok, but I don't know that it helps me sleep more deeply. I got it because my eyelids won't stay shut during the night (even with regular sleep masks) and are severely dry. It does seem to help them stay shut a little more than usual, but I'm a side sleeper so it would probably work even better on a back sleeper. It's definitely not too heavy or too light, and it doesn't make me hot."
"This is helping me relax before sleep and throughout the day, and I love it. My only concern is that the beads are made from polyethylene, which I'm having trouble finding information about in terms of whether or not it's 100% safe. I tend to wake up a few hours into the night feeling very hot until I take the mask off, but that could be due to using a fleece fabric in the height of summer. In any case, I'm pretty sure this mask isn't biodegradable, which I only realized after opening the package, so I'm docking one star on account of that regret. Otherwise it's a wonderful product."
Love it. Only problem is you can't wash it in the washing machine.
I work night shift so needed a mask to help sleep better during the day. The two different sides are very nice for when it's winter versus the summer months. I do think the pressure on my eyes helps me fall asleep faster. However if you are a person who moves a lot in your sleep then be prepared for it to fall off your face every once in a while.
I occasionally work night shifts and have trouble sleeping during the day. This definitely helps me fall asleep quicker but I'm not completely convinced that it helps me stay asleep as much.
Like it
"This eye pillow is different from others I have had in that it has four ""pillows"" that fit comfortably over my eyes when sleeping on my side or my back. I would prefer more weight but have not been able to find that anywhere."
"I like this, it could be a bit bigger and heavier but the design is nice. It seems crazy expensive for a small amount of fabric some poly pellets."
"Got this for my boyfriend who gets migraines and has trouble sleeping. He likes the pressure and that he can lay on his side and it's still comfortable. He has to tie it around his head to stay on, but it's not tight light a typical sleep mask elastic.When my eyes were sore, I put it in the freezer for maybe 5minutes and wore it over my eyes. It  doesn't freeze but it got cold enough to provide some pain relief.It doesn't get rid of your migraine by any means but it does ease the pain long enough for you to fall asleep. Better than a wet towel that drips and gets warm too quickly. Better than an eye mask that has no pressure.Bonus, comes in a cute tube. Not a generic box. 👍"
"This definitely helps me sleep faster but as a side sleeper, it falls off my face. I've tried to tie it in the back and that helps, but I always wake up with it off of my face. I like the weight on my eyes and love the dual side action it offers — nice to have a cooling feel some nights and warmer on other nights. Overall I like it :)"
"I see the vision behind this product, but it honestly didn't do any magical things for my sleep. It just doesn't live up to the hype for me, personally.I move and roll around too much in my sleep for it to stay in one place, despite trying to use the small hole in the back. It also doesn't have enough weight for me; the pressure is too gentle to give my eyes the relaxing feeling that a weighted blanket does for my body.I will say, it's very soft and comfy. If you're not a schmoover in your sleep, it will probably work much better for you than it did for me. I don't think it's a bad product — just a bad fit for my sleep habits."
"I have one in green.  Love so much.  Have given a NodPod as a gift to five people, including a white one.  I recently lost my green so ordered white.  I am disappointed it doesn't block the light nearly as well as green or dark grey (my son's)."
"The media could not be loaded.I've been searching for a quality eye mask that doesn't block my eyelids from opening, doesn't have buckles or clasps and has a therapeutic effect without slipping down/off my head before morning.Unfortunately the method of pulling the one end of the eye mask through the hole of the other end is not enough for securement. I'm having trouble finding masks that I don't wake up with the falling off, so maybe it's the size of my head being too small, but I feel Velcro, a button or something is needed.In terms of the weight, feel, material, those are all great."
I really wanted it to work for me as it did for others but I am a side sleeper and I toss and turn a lot. If I am on my side with this on then some of it rests on my ear and I can hear the little grains inside moving so it's quite loud. I have the same problem if I am moving from side to side.
"This is a lovely sleep mask, super soft, gorgeous color and obviously a well made product, BUT it's WAY to light. When they say ""gentle pressure"" they mean barely any at all. I'm sending it back. I'd rather drape a hand towel across my face for essentially the same pressure, and save $34."
"I own several nodpods — basically, one for each bed in my home and one for the sofa. To be clear, I generally like them. And I find them to be great for mid-day naps when I typically sleep on my back. They're soft and cool when first put on and the weight is just right for me. However, they heat up pretty fast (because of body heat), which can at times be less than comfortable. They also don't really fasten, so if you're not a back sleeper or you move too much during your sleep they will slide off. I'm only giving the product 3 stars because, despite my appreciation for the nodpod for napping purposes, the design is basically lacking. The slot that's supposed to allow you to pull the other end through (in an effort to fasten the eye mask) is WAY TOO SMALL/SHORT thereby rendering it useless. If they would've made the slot twice as long/wide I think it would've worked out but for some strange reason it's only about as wide as the diameter of a nickel. Given that the material used to make the nodpod is so plush, it's a struggle to pull it through a slot that's so small, and you're not going to get very far. So the mask will slide off if you move during sleep, and if you're a side or stomach sleeper, this eye mask will prove useless by the time sunrise rolls around. The design flaw can easily be fixed (just widen the slot for Pete's sake) but seeing as how they've gotten this far without doing so, I wouldn't be surprised if the manufacturer doesn't address the issue."
"I like the NodPod and have used it each night since receiving it on February 17. However, the stitching has come loose between two of the pods. This results in the contents shifting between the area of two pods…it is like having 2 normal pods and one really long one where the contents is distributed unevenly. Super annoying when you shift positions to sleep at night. The return window closed March 21 and I noticed the defect today, March 27. :("
"Update- after a few washes it is a bit softer but still not quite the same.I had one of these I bought at least two years ago, that I loved! I lost it while traveling and the replacement one I purchased does not feel like the same fabric. There is not a cool side, although each side has a different fabric both sides feel warm and the ""cool"" side makes me itch. My previous one on a cool night felt a little chilly at times and I would turn it to the warm side. After trying for a few nights with this itchy, warm eye mask I'm giving up and returning it."
"I have trouble with my silk sleep masks falling off, so I thought I'd try this. It's great while I'm sleeping on my back. It's comfortable, and the bit of added weight is relaxing. But I felt like I had to keep waking up to adjust it every time I switched sides. Fastening it around your head won't work for side sleepers because it's too thick. I ended up using it on top of my silk sleep mask. It holds it in place and for some reason doesn't move around as much when I switch sides."
"Product is long and good for Turing or moving as you fall asleep. It however is not weighted which is what is nice about eye pillows, the weight helps smooth and relax this part of the face. It is not scented which is fine but could be a nice addition. I like that it does not have to be strapped to my head"
"This eye pillow is too heavy to stay on my eyes while sleeping upright on a plane.  There is no way attach it securely at the back of my head, so I'm thinking of adding a velcro strip.  It's ok for sleeping horizontally, but I don't usually need to cover my eyes while I'm at home."
"Interesting concept, doen't work. Nothing special (except being expensive) versus a standard sleep eye mask. I recommend trying it, the quality is nice but it's not as comfortable as I expected it to be, nor is it helping fall sleep/stay asleep."
I love them but the stitching already went on one of the places that keep the beads in place. So it's a little annoying but it does help me sleep.
It's a bit heavy and only hold the cold or heat for about an hour
"I'm not exactly sure what's ""weighted "" about this product. It's about the same weight as a lavender Eyemask with no lavender. Super soft, i like it - just nothing special really."
"For me at least, the knot you have to tie in back comes loose and also creates a lump your head lays on. I don't use it."
Uncomfortable and not very effective
Not great for side sleeper. The beads are located almost all around so sleeping on your side isn't comfortable. Doesn't stay in place. Had high hopes for this and stopped using it
I would love to give these a 5 star but they just don't stay cold that long.
Not worth the price. Not as weighted as described.
